Clarke’s third law states that “any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.” Since 1960, SETI (Search for ExtraTerrestrial Intelligence) researchers have been searching for that ‘magic’ in the form of radio, and now optical, electromagnetic signals. These searches need to continue and grow utilizing the exponentially increasing capabilities of computing, but within the SETI field, we’ve always reserved the right to get smarter. In 2014, Karl Schroeder (Canadian futurist and science fiction author) suggested a variant of the Third Law; Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from Nature. What opportunities does this increased scope of the Third Law offer to our own 21 st century search for life beyond Earth? As we design and implement the next generations of ground and space-based observatories, some of whose primary goals are the imaging of exoplanets and the spectroscopic analysis of their atmospheres, we should consider how we might distinguish between the byproducts of microbes and mathematicians. We are vigorously discussing/debating the right instruments to develop and fly to find biosignatures – how can we find the technosignatures of the mathematicians?',\r\n\t\t'Jill Tarter is an astronomer and pioneer in the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI), and the co-founder and retired director of the SETI Institute. She has spent the majority of her professional career attempting to answer the age-old question, “Are we alone?” by searching for evidence of technological civilizations beyond Earth. She served as Project Scientist for NASA’s SETI program, the High Resolution Microwave Survey and has conducted numerous observational programs at radio observatories worldwide. She was named one of the Time 100 Most Influential People in the World in 2004, and one of the Time 25 in Space in 2012, received a TED prize in 2009, two public service awards from NASA, multiple awards for communicating science to the public, and has been honored as a woman in technology. She served as President of the California Academy of Sciences in 2015-16. In 2018 she was recognized with the Maria Mitchell Women in Science Award and the Sir Arthur Clarke Innovator’s Award. Since the termination of funding for NASA’s SETI program in 1993, she has served in a leadership role to design and build the Allen Telescope Array and to secure private funding for SETI. Dr. Tarter was also the primary inspiration for Ellie Arroway, the protagonist in the Carl Sagan’s 1985 novel Contact, and played by Jodie Foster in the 1997 movie rendition of the book.',\r\n\t\tJill,\r\n\t\t'/past-events',\r\n\t\t'https://calendar.google.com/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=MnFtbWF2dWRuMDA2N3VvMmtncHN0Y2xoM20gbHM5OGJuMml0MGFqZWxxbThkdjdubm42ZTBAZw&tmsrc=ls98bn2it0ajelqm8dv7nnn6e0%40group.calendar.google.com',\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t'This event has passed.',\r\n\t],\r\n\t[\r\n\t\t'Gene Luen Yang',\r\n\t\t'Author of American Born Chinese',\r\n\t\t'September 19, 2019 | 6:00pm - 7:30pm | 230 Cheit Hall, UC Berkeley',\r\n\t\t'Asians and Asian-Americans are often portrayed as upholding some or all of the stereotypes formed against them, such as being exotic, rich, smart, and/or wimpy with glasses.

In your book you chronicle your\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlife from growing up the child of immigrants, to your time at\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tuniversity, studying everything from engineering to law and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbusiness, to your time in Silicon Valley working with a number of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstartups to eventually your suit against Kleiner Perkins. Throughout\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis journey, at what point did you come to believe that the system\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou are entering had been built in a way that limited your ability\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto succeed?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Ellen Pao:</strong> For a long time, I thought it was either\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tme or an individual. So, if there was an all-male steak dinner at\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe law firm that I was at, I thought, “Well, that guy who organized\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit, what a jerk,” and I’ll just go and organize my own dinner with\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmy friends and we would have our dinner. But you know I didn’t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trealize until much, much later and I was out of the field of law\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat actually, those dinners with partners, are different than\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdinners with peers, right. They’re networking opportunities, they’re\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\topportunities to get visibility. They’re opportunities to be seen so\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat when the good opportunities come up, you’re considered, you’re\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the mix, you’re known. So, it wasn’t as a lawyer, it was much\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlater. It wasn’t until I was at Kleiner. So, throughout my career,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthere’d be little things that I would notice but brush off or I\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould just work harder, but I would continue to succeed. So, I was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlucky enough to be able to continue to move up in every job that I\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad and it wasn’t until I was at Kleiner Perkins when I hit a wall.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBut really, the thing that had me understand how systemic it was,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas seeing all the other women hit the same wall. So, there was one\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpromotion time where none of the women got promoted and almost all\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe men got promoted. We had…the women had better education, more\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twork experience before joining Kleiner, more years at Kleiner on\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taverage, overall. One of the women had actually done this detailed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tanalysis investment by investment, partner by partner, to show that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe woman’s investments were actually doing much better than the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmen’s investments. And yet, despite the education, the experience on\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdifferent levels and the better investments, none of the women got\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpromoted, most of the men got promoted and that was a clear signal\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto me that something was wrong.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Shaina Zuber:</strong> Did you feel like the other people at\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe firm were cognizant of this disparity and ignored it or simply\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdidn’t even notice?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Ellen Pao:</strong> I think there were people who noticed it\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand were like, “Just work through.” There was one person who advised\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tme, like, “Forget about the dinners but this board seat that they\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttook you off of, you should really be fighting for that.” So, pick\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyour battles basically. I think the men were not cognizant. I think\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthere were certain small things that I think some of them were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcognizant of but it wasn’t big enough for them to do anything and it\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twasn’t something that they saw as systemic.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Shaina Zuber:</strong> While you were working at Kleiner\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPerkins in venture capital you were essentially seated at the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tintersection of the tech world and high finance, both of which are\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tindustries which have been criticized for the treatment of female\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\temployees there. How did you feel these two industries were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdifferent and similar in how women were treated and potential\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdiscrimination they faced?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Ellen Pao:</strong> It’s hard to say because I worked in a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttech field at a different time. Like I worked in tech from 1998 to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2005 and that was when it was still the nerds who were working. It\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas very much like people who were engineers, they were interested\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin building product or technologies and it was much geekier. In\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2008, it changed quite a bit because Wall Street all of a sudden,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecame toxic or the toxicity was more public and people didn’t want\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto go to Wall Street anymore. It was a time where the banks were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstarting to fail and people coming out of business school like Haas,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdecided I’d rather go to tech where I can see that these guys from\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGoogle are now billionaires and they built their companies in 7 or 8\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyears and became billionaires with public offerings. Mark Zuckerberg\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas starting to come up and there was this idea that the way to make\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmoney is to go to Silicon Valley and no longer to go to Wall Street\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand that changed the culture. So, I think the culture got much more\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttoxic after 2008. So, it’s different than when I was there. If I\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlook at venture, I think the big difference between venture and all\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof tech is that it’s such a small group of people, it’s such a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconcentration of power. There are the relationships, there are the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpeople who can make companies and they’re king makers. They pick a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tperson and they invest in them and they put money into them and it\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdoesn’t matter what they do, they are able to get repeated chances.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tYou look at the guy from Zenefits. He was fired for fraud and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbuilding software to get around insurance regulations and yet he\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstarted a new company and raised several million dollars from the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsame investors who had just barred him a year or so ago. So, you get\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmultiple chances if you’re in that in-group and there are just a few\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpeople who can make or break your company and that drives into the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcompanies that they invest in and sets the tone for the rest of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tindustry. So, that concentration of power and the influence is\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincredibly strong.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Shaina Zuber:</strong> As you mentioned, venture does have a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlarge impact on what companies succeed and which ones fail. In 2016,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcompanies run by men received 16 times as much funding from venture\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcapital firms as those run by women. What do you think drives this\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdisparity and capital allocation and what do you believe should be\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdone to address it?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Ellen Pao:</strong> So, they call it pattern matching and I\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthink in that speech that I was here for, like 7 or 10 years ago, I\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthink there was probably talk about what makes for a successful\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcompany. One of the things that that my firm used to talk about is\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhite male nerds who dropped out of school. So, they looked at the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpattern of the guys from Yahoo, the guys from Google, Mark\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tZuckerberg and the success factors that they decided were most\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\timportant, were white, male, nerd and that ended up being the people\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat they invested in. As time went on, those ended up being the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpeople that were successful because they were the only people who\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgot investment. So, you end up with this self-fulfilling prophecy\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich all of a sudden, looks like the numbers that you shared. Like\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmore and more investment goes into this small group of people and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tothers are shut out of the whole process.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Shaina Zuber:</strong> Do you think there are any trends\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttowards improvement in this or has it been pretty static since\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou’ve been in Silicon Valley?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Ellen Pao:</strong> I think the latest numbers have gotten\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tworse. So, it’s been pretty static. I’m encouraged though, by the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfact that now there are some small funds that are run by women, that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tare run by underrepresented people of color. I think there is more\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tawareness of the problem and I think there are people who are\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trecognizing that. There are women and people of color who are a huge\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\topportunity to invest in because others are not looking at those\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsectors. So, there are all these awesome entrepreneurs that are\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgetting shut down or rejected by the mainstream investors that have\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgreat ideas, that have great teams, that have great opportunities\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand the ability to invest in them without having to fight off 10\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tother venture capitalists is an incredible opportunity.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Shaina Zuber:</strong> You mentioned in your book that while\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou were at Kleiner Perkins working in this sort of environment, you\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treally stressed this issue of maternity leave and how taking\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmaternity leave could have detrimental effects on people’s careers,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand people could feel forced into working when they were on\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmaternity leave. How do you think this issue should be addressed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teither through policy solutions or a change in culture or both?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Ellen Pao:</strong> I think it’s a mix. So, when I was at a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlaw firm in 1994, 1995, there was one woman who was there who had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen there for a long time. She started in law before women could\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tactually go to law school. So, women would have to apprentice. So,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshe apprenticed with a lawyer in order to be eligible to pass the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbar and work as a lawyer. She said to me, like, “If society values\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpeople raising their kids, they need to make it possible for people\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto work and raise their kids at the same time. So, if it values\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twomen being involved in raising kids, then women should be given\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tways to be able to raise their kids while still working.” If you\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlook at companies now, they’re looking at parental leave instead of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmaternity leave and I think that helps a lot. If you make it so that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit’s something that both genders or all the genders experience\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tequally, then people can be more empathetic. “Right, look, I want to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttake this time off but I’m feeling all this pressure not to because\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpeople don’t think that paternity leave really makes sense, maybe\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI’ll feel more empathetic to the person who’s trying to take leave\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas well.” I think it’s a mental shift in trying to understand, like\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdo we value people raising their kids, do we value people working,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdo we want them back in the workforce, do we want to include\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teveryone in these opportunities and make sure that we have everybody\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tparticipating to the full extent of their capabilities?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Shaina Zuber:</strong> You mentioned in your book that you\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdid try to implement something of a cultural shift during your time\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas interim CEO at Reddit, and one of the policies you implemented\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas to ask potential employees questions to discern their views on\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdiversity.

I think it\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas before, it was pre-Google manifesto, people weren’t talking\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabout those views as openly. But I did have one person who said that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\the believed in diversity and he was willing to lower the bar to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbring in women and people of color.

I think what we did was we gave everybody\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe highest negotiated salary we’d be willing to give. So, we had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbands and we would put everybody at the top of their bands based on\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir experience and their skills and the job that we were hiring\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor. It worked out really well because I think there’s this tension\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbetween the candidate and the employer where they want to feel like\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey’ve negotiated well but they also don’t want to burn the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trelationship. And as the employer, you want to hire them but you’d\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\talso want to pay fairly across your whole team and we could see at\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tReddit, there were some managers who were more generous than other\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmanagers. You could say they were actually worse negotiators,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdepending on your perspective and then there were some employees who\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere really strong negotiators and they were just way out of band.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSo, you look at that and it’s completely unfair and for us to really\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstick to the bands, we wanted to make sure that we’re giving people\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe amount that we thought they were worth which would be at the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thigh part of the band.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Shaina Zuber:</strong> And this was implemented across all\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlevels of the company?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Ellen Pao:</strong> Yes, I looked at every offer and I had a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trecruiter, Phil Haig, who…we put every offer together and we would\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgo through the bands and we’d say, like, “How many years of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texperience do they have in this particular skill set?” So, it was a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlittle bit time-consuming. We would have had to do it differently at\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tscale, we were pretty small then but you felt better. Like when you\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgave the offer, you felt better and there were candidates that would\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsay, “God, you know, this is a really generous offer. This is more\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthan I would have asked for. I really feel good about it because I\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdon’t feel like I have to negotiate for myself. I’m not comfortable\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnegotiating for myself and I’m super excited to take the job.” And\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twe would cut out like 1 or 2 weeks of awkwardness where you’d give\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tout the offer and you wouldn’t hear anything and then you’re like,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t“Maybe we should have given more or what are they thinking?” And\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey would call back and they would want to negotiate but they\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\talready felt like it was a good offer, so they weren’t sure how much\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto negotiate.And there’s that whole awkward set of interactions\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhere it’s a little bit of tension because you want more and the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcompany wants to give you less, maybe, so you’re at odds, but this\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcreated this much more positive experience and also, we could close\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpeople faster. So, we could get them in the door and for us, we were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowing really quickly and that ended up being a huge benefit that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twe hadn’t anticipated.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Shaina Zuber:</strong> Have you seen this being replicated\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin other firms across the industry?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Ellen Pao:</strong> There are other companies that are doing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit.

I think it depends on, like what are your other\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfinancial obligations, where you, you know, you could have family\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmoney, you could have a spouse that works, you could have saved a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlot of money? So, I think it’s more, what is your specific\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsituation, if you don’t have kids or if you don’t have a family to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsupport elsewhere, if you don’t have other obligations, it’s\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdifferent. Also, it depends on your appetite for risk.

There’s\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta group Ascend, that is a nonprofit that is coming out with a new\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treport, I think, in a few weeks and they’ve looked at race and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgender to see how people get promoted and how people get hired.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThey’ve shown very specific differences. When you’re basically not a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhite male, the further away you are, the harder it is for you to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tget to the top and the harder it is for you to succeed and it\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdiffers by category. But I think it’s also hard to focus so much\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tattention on different groups. I think it’s important to understand\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thow race plays a factor into it but it’s often used to pit one group\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst another. So, it’s like, “Well, Asians shouldn’t be part of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis conversation because at least they get hired or Latinx people\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshouldn’t be part of this conversation because they can assimilate\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbetter, right” So, there’s a lot of competition that ends up like,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t“Well, my situation is worse, so I should get more benefit or your\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsituation is less bad, so you should make room for my group.” I\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthink that’s really hard, when the focus should be on, like, there’s\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta systemic problem where people are not being included and we need\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto change the whole system so that everybody gets included fairly.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSo, it’s not, “I’m going to have one slot for a woman and then once\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI put that woman in, nobody else gets to be on that panel or in that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texecutive suite. Or I’m going to put a slot for diversity and once I\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfill that with, whether it’s an Asian person or a black person or a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLatinex person or somebody with a different sexual orientation, then\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI’m done.” That is kind of attitude when you start parsing through\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvery closely, when people start talking about kind of trying to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcompare different groups. I think it should very much be like, who\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tare the best people for these opportunities, who should we be\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlistening to, who should we be getting perspectives from and that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshould be everybody. We can’t… You know, I see a lot of it, where\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlike groups are starting to… Where this fragmentation is super toxic\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand really, we need to be working together to make sure that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teverybody gets a fair chance to succeed.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Shaina Zuber:</strong> For the sake of time, this is going\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto be my last question before we move on to audience questions.

People at\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmy office were scared to talk to me. I was a social piranha. There\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas one who talked to me for a few months but we had to meet outside\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe office and she would leave 5 minutes before I left and we would\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmeet way far away from the office because she did not want to be\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tseen with me. So, that was a very lonely, hard time. People would\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmove away when I sat down at a table. Like it was very kind of high\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tschoolish but it was hard because we had been there for 7 years and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthese were the people that I had worked and spent so much time with.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBut people would email me and they would send me supportive messages\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand a few people said things publicly and then it grew over time and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou saw other people speak about their own experiences. And it\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twasn’t just women or women of color, it was also men saying, “This\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thappened to my mom or this happened to my coworker and she told me\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause she had read about your experiences. I believe you, even\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthough the press is completely attacking you and saying that you’re\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot telling the truth, I believe you,” and that can be very\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpowerful. So, you don’t have to go out and sue, you don’t have to go\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tout and take huge steps but just speaking up for other people. When\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyour classmate or your coworker is always asked to get the coffee or\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tget the cookies or take the notes, you can speak up and say,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t“Actually, it seems like she’s done that several times. Why don’t I\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdo it or why don’t we have it go through everybody and the whole\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tteam does it from time to time?” So that it’s not that person’s\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadditional burden to speak up and fix the mistake.

We see a lot of companies who are focused on women and at\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe end, that means white women usually. And it means that they’re\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\topening up the boys’ club and adding a few people but the general\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tculture is that some people are in the in-group and some people are\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot in the in-group and just because you add a few more people to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe in-group, doesn’t mean you’re an inclusive company. So, thinking\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabout it from the perspective of, how do I give everyone a fair\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchance to succeed? The second point, comprehensiveness, is tied to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmaking sure that it’s everything in your company. So, it’s not just,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlet me hire a few people and throw them into the company and hope\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey swim. It’s really, like your processes for hiring, your\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprocesses for promoting, for paying people, for giving performance\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treviews, for giving opportunities, giving visibility, for giving\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsponsorship and mentorship, should be fair and it should be\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinclusive. And then the last piece is, you need to be accountable\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand you need to measure what’s going on in your company to make sure\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat you are seeing progress and that you’re taking steps that are\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tactually working. One of the things that we’ve seen that there’s a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlot of research on, is that when you have the consultant come in and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdo the 90-minute unconscious bias training, it can actually be\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thurtful to attitudes and hurtful to diversity and inclusion in your\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcompany. So, really thinking about, like what are all the steps and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhat are the ongoing things you’re going to do to make the company\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tactually inclusive is really important.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Audience Member:</strong> Hi, there, my name is Olivia I’m a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcomputer science student here. So, I often find myself surrounded by\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tall men because, you know, project groups, classes, extracurriculars\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand more and more, the conversation of diversity does come up. But a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlot of times, I’m the only diverse candidate or a female candidate\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tetc. in those conversations. So, I guess I wanted to know like what\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyour advice would be, because oftentimes those conversations can get\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta little bit tense or it’s kind of awkward. So, like what advice\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould you have to create meaningful and productive conversation?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Ellen Pao:</strong> It’s a hard one because, like, it’s\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgreat to educate people but it’s exhausting, right. So, in every\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconversation, people turn to you because you’re the only person who\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdoesn’t look like them and you’re expected to do the work of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teducating all of them. I think a big part of it is trying to get\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpeople to educate themselves. So, you can hopefully, tell them,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlike, “There’s so much information out there on the Internet, in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmedium, on Twitter, in all different magazines,” to push them to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tactually do some homework. Like, “Hey, that doesn’t seem like a very\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teducated opinion, you should actually do some research, right. Go\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGoogle diversity and intersectionality and learn something.” But\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit’s hard because you’ll feel like you want to but I think you have\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto think about, like what are you willing to do, does it make sense\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor you to do? And also, are there some people that you just can’t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchange their minds, right. Like why put energy into that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconversation if they’re really difficult and it’s exhausting. You\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlet go and find somebody else to talk to you hopefully.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Audience Member:</strong> I’m Wendy Yang.

So, this is something, like it’s not going to be related\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto your work but it’s more about Reddit. Do you…despite with what\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thappened last year with Reddit, with r/The_Donald and r/pizzagate,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdo you still stand by your defense of not banning the subreddits\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdespite with what happened last year?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Ellen Pao:</strong> So, I actually banned 5 subreddits. So,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI banned five subreddits that were harassing other users of Reddit\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand I personally would have banned The_Donald. I think they were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tharassing people, driving people off of a platform and it was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsomething that has been really toxic and now the measures to try to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfix it aren’t are kind of convoluted. Like if they had just stopped\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit in the early days, it would have been a lot easier. So, I think\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthere’s a difference between stopping people for hate speech and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstopping people for harassment and that was the line that I drew.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIt’s too hard to define hate speech. You have a whole law school\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\there where the professors are going to debate it and, in a company,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou’re dealing with millions of posts and a small team of people who\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tare being paid by the hour. And expecting them to be able to manage\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tall of the hate speech and get rid of it is hard, but expecting them\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto identify harassment, you know, people who are really pushing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpeople off a platform or creating this toxic environment for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tindividuals, is something that I think is doable.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Audience Member:</strong> Hi Ellen thank you so much for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeing here. My name is Divya and I’m a senior here at Haas. A\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquestion that I had for you has to go back to, I guess, unconscious\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbias and also the role of female ally-ship and sponsorship. I think\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou mentioned this before, that in the beginning of your fight or\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe beginning of you pushing towards this, it was often times even\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlonely from your, I guess, fellow sisters or even female mentors as\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twell as co-workers. So, what recommendations do you have for either\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsomeone who’s receiving this and feels maybe alone in the fight but\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\talso, how we, not only as women but as Berkeley students as a whole,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcan provide more of a sponsorship or ally-ship with people going\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthrough this?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Ellen Pao:</strong> It’s a good question because I hear from\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta lot of people, they’re like, “Oh, the advice I’ve been given is I\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tneed to go find a mentor, right. Let me go find a mentor, I don’t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treally know how to do it.” I was told to find a mentor and I asked a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbunch of people and they didn’t want to be my mentor. So, it doesn’t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfeel very good. So, I think you realize that you actually do have\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmentors. So, if you think about, like who did you talk to you when\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou were trying to decide what to major in, who did you talk to you\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhen you were trying to decide what school to go to. Those are your\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttrusted advisors that you could call “mentors.” You kind of, as you\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmove along, you’ll find more people who are helpful in that way and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou can do the same for other people. You provide the advice based\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton your experiences and as you gain more experiences, as you enter\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe workforce, you’ll be able to share the same amount of…you’ll be\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\table provide help to people and hopefully, they’ll be providing help\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto you and building that reciprocal relationship can be very\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpowerful.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Audience Member:</strong> Hi, Ellen, my name is RJ. I’m a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsenior here at UC Berkeley studying computer science. So, I wanted\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto ask two questions. My first question is, in terms of, as you\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsaid, that currently diversity programs are kind of basically, like\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thiring a diversity or underrepresented minority and then putting\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem…once the quota has been filled, it’s kind of like ignore\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teveryone else. So, currently, we see that this doesn’t really work,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe gap hasn’t changed as well as also, there’s been recent backlash\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover this policy. So, how would you suggest, like do you think\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthere’s anything you would improve on that policy or like how would\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou go about it?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Ellen Pao:</strong> Yes, I think the big problem is like you\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthrow people into an environment and expect them to succeed when it\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thas been built on decades of exclusion. It’s very hard. Like if you\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlook at the way companies are operated, especially the bigger\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcompanies. They follow this path where they hire their friends.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tVenture started, I think, maybe 40 or 50 years ago and it was a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgroup of eight guys who came out of the semiconductor industry and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey started funding companies and they funded people who looked\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlike them, who were their friends and then they funded their\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfriends. It just became this very kind of culture fit based system.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAnd as things continued, like you built systems that were oriented\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taround, “How do I hire people who look like my friends and look like\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tme?” So, all the hiring processes, all the promotion processes… You\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tknow, you look at the 360-review process, it’s all oriented towards\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tkeeping a certain set of people, the traditional establishment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuccessful. So, it’s really kind of taking apart all of those things\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand maybe bringing in technology. There are a bunch of great\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttechnology companies that are designed to root out bias in hiring\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand managing, in performance reviews, in job descriptions. So, there\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tare a lot of tools that you can use but it’s like the mindset of, “I\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tknow there’s a problem and I’m going to fix it.” I think for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstudents coming out of school now, it’s like, where do I find those\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcompanies that are better than others? I don’t think there’s a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tperfect company. I would love to say, “These are the five companies\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou should go work for.” I think that we have a long way to go\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbefore any of these companies have leadership and engineering teams\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand overall representation that looks like the workforce, you know,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdemographics of the workforce in their company workforces, but there\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tare companies that are better than others and you can tell by\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlooking at their website. You can tell by looking at their\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tleadership teams, their boards. I would use that as my guide to try\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto find the companies that are doing better than others.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Audience Member:</strong> And my second question, if I can,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tis regarding…so, recently, we had our free speech week here at\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBerkeley and given your experience with the incident, I’ve read it.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSo, would you say the response by Christ was appropriate or how\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould you might have responded if you were in her position?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Ellen Pao:</strong> We were talking about this backstage. It\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tis such a hard, complicated issue. I’ve not looked deeply into\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBerkeley’s experience but I will tell you that as someone who… I was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis college reporter on the school newspaper and I was super\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpro-free speech. It was like this great way of getting out ideas, of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeing very open and transparent about things that were happening and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas I’ve seen the internet evolve, it has made free speech into a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tweapon against certain people who disenfranchised. There was a time\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat reddit where we had these nude unauthorized pictures of various\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstars and celebrities and we ended up, like being the site for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfinding those nude pictures and it drowned out all other\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconversations because so many people were walking to the site to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttake a look at these nude pictures. We couldn’t keep up the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconversation. So, we ended up becoming the site for nude pictures.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIf you think about what happens when you allow these really loud\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvoices who are so toxic and driving off all the other people on your\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsite, you don’t have conversations. You have like the loudest most\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvisible group taking over the whole site and you have conversations\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand you don’t have a place where people feel like they can\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tparticipate. I think it’s hard because it’s a public institution and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause it’s had this commitment to free speech from the start, but\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI think the world has changed and evolved and there’s a big part of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta community and a platform that involves making sure people are free\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom harassment, that people have the opportunity to speak and that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat a college, that one of your values is inclusion, of making sure\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat everybody feels safe to exist and to be able to participate. I\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdon’t think that happens when you have voices that are telling you\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat, you don’t belong, that you’re not equal and that you should\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot be given opportunities thank you.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Audience Member:</strong> Hi, my name is Terrell, I’m a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsenior studying computer science and philosophy. I have a little\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstory to tell. This summer while I was interning at big tech\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcompany, I kept noticing these things you were talking about such as\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuperficial diversity measures, tokenism. I ended up writing a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tletter to the Chief Diversity Inclusion Officer of that company and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe letter, I also posted on the intern group and it was spread and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsomehow leaked from the intern group and many full-time engineers\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\talso saw it and they kind of circulated it around the company. Time\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand time again, the backlash… There was a lot of backlash but the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmost prominent backlash I got was that I was being offended for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsomeone else. That I, as a Asian male in tech is relatively\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprivileged and that for those reasons, I shouldn’t be the person\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho’s saying these kinds of things. So, for someone like me, who’s\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trelatively privileged or even a white male in tech, how do you\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadvise someone like me who still wants to be in the conversation,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlike navigate this?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Ellen Pao:</strong> So, it’s hard for me to understand\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texactly what happened.

That is part\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof what happens in tech to women and people of color and older\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpeople and people who have disabilities and people who have\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdifferent sexual orientations. Like, that is what happens. There is\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta traditional establishment view and when you have a counter view,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpeople try to squash it and that… You know, so, I think you have to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe prepared for it. It’s not pretty but that is like the start of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchange. So, in some people’s minds, they probably agree with you but\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit’s hard to do that publicly at this point but maybe there’ll be\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsomebody next summer who says the same thing, and maybe there’ll be\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta few people then and maybe there’ll be some people from the team\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho then join in. But being the first to call out problems is often\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot… You don’t feel like you’re making a difference but you do. Like\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit takes a village to change things and that means many different\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpeople speaking up at different times.So, I think you should be\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treally…like it’s brave and you should be proud of yourself for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thaving done that and I don’t think you should look at it as, “I was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta failure,” or internalize the criticisms. It’s very much, you know,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou tried to do the right thing and even if it didn’t work, I think\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou can feel good about yourself having said it rather than seeing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmore and more problems and you didn’t try to do something.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Shaina Zuber:</strong> I think for the sake of time, we have\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttime for one more audience question.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Audience Member:</strong> Oh, good.

I am work in VC and have definitely been asked to bring\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcoffee from entrepreneurs, but my question is we hear these things\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabout how important diverse opinions are in a VC setting. I was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twondering if you can tell us some tangible things that you have\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texperienced by having a female investor in the room, in your partner\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmeetings, in the discussions that you have. And what has…what has\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thaving like all white male VC’s gotten us so far? I mean, what are\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsome problems because of that?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Ellen Pao:</strong> I think you see… I think one of the most\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\timpressive things about the tech sector has been this massive\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcreation of wealth and power in a short amount of time. And what\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou’ve seen with the white male VCs, is that it stays in that group\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand all of these other groups are excluded from this creation of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twealth, this creation of power, this ability to donate to create\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\topportunities for people who haven’t been able to participate. This\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tability to hire people, this ability to share the wealth more\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbroadly and to help communities and that’s a huge problem. I think\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby investing in these homogeneous groups, you end up with products\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlike Nextdoor. Which is, you know, every time I go, there’s some\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tracist comment about like, “I’ve seen this person from this\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdemographic and I think they were stealing things. Here’s a picture\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof them,” right. And I’m like, “What is that, and how are people on\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tteam not stopping it?” And not to pick on Nextdoor because there\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tare… You know Google is like, they can’t distinguish pieces from\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdifferent races. You look at all of these different groups. You look\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat Airbnb, their platform has ways to… They’re now struggling with\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttrying to correct this element of racism on their platform. It’s\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause you don’t have people who look like your user base involved\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the products. You’re not making the best decisions and you’re not\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsurfacing the problems early enough, right, because you don’t have\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tany friends from that demographic, because you don’t have anybody in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat circle because all of your friends are in tech and they all\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlook the same. So, there’s like the… You get better products, you\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmake better decisions, you have better financial results but also,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit’s the right thing to do in this environment. So, hopefully,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthings will change but it’s not like this incremental change.

My question is, how has the political\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlandscape changed while you’ve been reporting and how has that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchanged you?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Ana Kasparian:</strong> The political landscape, I would\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsay, hasn’t really changed for the better. I’m actually pretty\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tworried about it considering how this election went down. Now, for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthose who are supportive of Donald Trump, I would hope that you\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdon’t at least agree with the rhetoric. But I think that this\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\telection has really opened the floodgates for some scary times and I\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthink that we need to take a step back and think about the way that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twe perceive one another, the way we disagree with one another, the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tway we interact with one another. I’ve seen politics become more\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcorrupt, which I think has led to the backlash toward candidates\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlike Hillary Clinton. And what we need to do more than anything,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhether you’re Republican or Democrat, is fight to take our\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdemocracy back. I think the biggest issue for everyone who’s\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinterested in politics, for everyone who cares about our democracy\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tis getting that money out of politics. And it’s actually the most\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnon-partisan issue impacting us right now. There are Republicans and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDemocrats right now that see this as a big problem, and they want to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdo something about it. So I would say that politics has definitely\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecome more corrupt and with this election, it’s gotten bigger.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong> Jackson Rigley:</strong> This corruption – you’re referring\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto Citizens United as being a part of that – so what kind of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsolutions then do you bring about? Because obviously there are\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconstitutional difficulties with freedom of speech and trying to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\toverturn the Citizens United ruling, so what is the best way of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbringing about this change?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Ana Kasparian:</strong> Well, I don’t agree that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcorporations are people – I think that’s a ridiculous notion. So I\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdon’t think that this is a freedom of speech issue. Now, with that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsaid, what I think is important is that we have public financing of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\telections. So one proposal – and I’m personally tied to this – is to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcreate a constitutional amendment to get money out of politics.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThere’s a political action committee known as Wolf PAC that TYT has\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlaunched. What we want to do is to get state representatives to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagree to a constitutional convention where there will be dialogue\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabout how we move about with a constitutional amendment. And I think\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit’s doable. States like California, I believe Vermont as well, have\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\talready signed on for this, so people get it. And this is the good\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthing about this – it’s not a partisan issue, so it’s not like we’re\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thaving a debate about abortion. We’re not having a debate about gay\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trights. We’re having a debate about democracy. And so Democrats get\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit, Republicans get it, Independents get it, the Green Party gets\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit, everybody gets it. We’ve actually had Republican state\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trepresentatives sign off on this, which is great. It’s a long road\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tahead of us, and sometimes we feel discouraged because we launched\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis back in And even if it’s a slow progression, I do see us moving\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttowards progress, because people are tired of corruption. And again,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI think the election of Donald Trump shows that, even though he’s\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsomeone as I mentioned earlier, who benefits from that corruption\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquite a bit.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Jackson Rigley:</strong> Now in your address, you’re very\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcritical of mainstream media which has a lot of influential\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadvertisements. I’d like to ask you, as a political commentator,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhat value do you bring to the democratic process. Does partisan\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommentary work to further dogma?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Ana Kasparian:</strong> Yeah, I come from a progressive\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpoint of view and I think the important thing is to always be honest\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith your audience. It doesn’t matter if you’re watching CNN or The\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tYoung Turks, you are getting a point of view. The question is are\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou getting a point of view that’s open and honest and transparent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tor are you getting reporters who are pretending to be objective.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThere’s a difference between being objective and being neutral. And\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhat you see a lot in the media is this confusion – or confusion\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tisn’t the right word. You see reporters attempting to be objective,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhen in reality, they’re just treating both sides as if they’re\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tequal when they’re not equal. I’ll give you a quick example. I was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twatching Hardball with Chris Matthews on MSNBC today, and I don’t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tknow why I do this, but whenever I’m traveling for work, I love\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twatching the mainstream media. It’s because I don’t have cable, like\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI won’t pay for cable, it’s just not worth it.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Jackson Rigley:</strong> When you’re alone in a hotel room,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit’s nice to have a voice.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t[audience laughter]\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Ana Kasparian:</strong> Yeah, it’s nice to have a voice, and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI love to watch and get angry at the TV. So, I’m watching Hardball\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand Chris Matthews is supposed to be a liberal, but he had this\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmontage where he was comparing Donald Trump and Barack Obama. Now,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey had their meeting today, and a lot of people are confused about\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit, whether they get along or what happened. And Chris Matthews was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlike how could they possibly get along? Look at the terrible ways\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey attacked one another. And so you see Trump, and Trump’s like\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t“Show me your birth certificate! You’re black, you can’t be an\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAmerican!” – he didn’t say that, but that was what was implied. And\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit was hideous, Donald Trump is pretty brutal and hideous to him.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAnd then, Obama’s attacks were “This is unacceptable rhetoric, we\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcan’t talk to each other this way, he’s trying to divide us.” It was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tjust like a completely different way of dealing with someone. And so\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe way the montage was put together, it had made it seem as though\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey were both equal – but they’re not equal to each other. They’re\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot both equal. I’m not a big fan of Barack Obama, i think that in a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlot of ways, he has failed us. But, to say that he uses the same\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttone and the same rhetoric as Donald Trump in attacking Donald Trump\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tis ridiculous. And so, that kind of neutrality is unacceptable in my\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbook. You need to be a truth-teller.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Jackson Rigley:</strong> Now, before we speak more about the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\telection, because obviously that’s something we will get to, I have\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto ask you a little bit more about the name of the show, Young\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTurks. Because as the group that committed the Armenian Genocide\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhere more than 1.5 million people died in 1915, can you explain to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tme a little bit more about this name or what I’m missing, because it\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\talmost seems if someone because they enjoy states’ rights uses the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tConfederate flag as a symbol. Can you explain that?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Ana Kasparian:</strong> Yeah, so the Confederate flag or a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tword like Nazi means one thing. So a lot of people like to attack us\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand say, “Oh it’s just like naming your show the Young Nazis.” But\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe English definition of Turk, Young Turk, is someone who rebels\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst societal expectations. I’m Armenian, and I get it, Armenians\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tare angry with the name of the show. I can be as honest as I want, I\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thate the name of the show. I despise the name of the show. If I\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcould do anything in the world right now, I would snap my fingers\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand the name of the show would be different. Unfortunately, the name\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof a show is a brand, and once you change it, the brand disappears.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAnd so, we’ve had so many talks about this, so many tears have been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcried, so many difficult moments have been had, and it’s been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdifficult for me personally. Now, that said, the name of the show is\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot meant to hearken back to a genocidal group – that would be a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treally bad business idea. You know the intention of the name is,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tright – we want to be rebels, we’re rebelling against societal\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpectations. What a lot of people don’t even realize – which is\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhat I find interesting – is the Young Turks originally arose to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchallenge the Ottoman Empire which was horrendous to Armenians. And\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tso, at first, they actually wanted to give Armenians more rights\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause they were disenfranchised and treated horrendously by the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOttomans and that’s how it started out. But then there were rebels\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twithin the rebels. There were rebels within the Young Turks that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twanted to continue being horrendous to the Armenians, and so, that’s\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe group that of course, that I hate, I despise beyond words could\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teven explain or describe. My family was tortured, brutalized by\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTurks and so it’s a difficult issue for me to even talk about\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twithout getting emotional. But I just want to assure you guys we\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thave no intentions of denying the genocide, I’ve talked about the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgenocide on the show. There are videos about the Genocide on the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tYoung Turks’ channel. I was able to do those videos with Cenk’s\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tblessing so I encourage you guys to check that out, but I hear you,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI totally understand where our viewers are coming from.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Jackson Rigley:</strong> You’ve been very outspoken, in that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tregard, is it something that you feel like is reasonable that people\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tare still reticent of the name? Do you get maybe some more insight\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinto how commercial imperatives for other markets, and for other\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnewspeople play into their decision-making? Because you know keeping\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto the name because of brand recognition, there are other\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\timperatives around media. Does that give you insight?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Ana Kasparian:</strong> We’re not really worried about other\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmembers of the media or anything like that. We’re more concerned\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabout not disappearing because we’ve worked so hard to build what we\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thave and changing the name means that we disappear. That’s why we\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttry to refer to us as TYT, every time I introduce as the host of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tYoung Turks, I kind of cringe a little bit, if I’m going to be\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thonest with you. But I had to make a decision and ultimately my\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdecision was to stick with the show that didn’t censor me and gave\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tme a voice.

And\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tso, Donald Trump did do well with white female voters, which I think\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tis telling. And Hillary Clinton did well with minority women.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Jackson Rigley:</strong> Why do you think that’s so?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Ana Kasparian:</strong> I mean it’s telling considering the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trhetoric that Donald Trump has used throughout his campaign. I think\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teven his strongest supporters could agree that some of the things\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat he’s said about minorities has been offensive, and beyond\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquestionable – talking about banning Muslims, referring to Mexican\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\timmigrants as rapists and criminals. I mean that kind of language\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tturns a lot of minorities off. But I think the reason why a lot of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpeople were kind of just able to brush that kind of rhetoric under\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe rug and vote for him anyway is because they are tired of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstatus quo. I don’t think that all Trump supporters are necessarily\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbad people so I don’t want anyone to think that I have that frame of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmind. I think some of them, that we’ve interviewed during our field\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treports are very clear about their bigotry and very honest about\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir bigotry which concerns me, but I think that a lot of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpeople that voted for him really believed that he’s\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tanti-establishment and he’s really going to change things. There are\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpeople that feel the economic burden of failed policies, but again\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tif you want to focus on the mainstream media, his economic proposals\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thave a lot to do with trickle down economics and we’ve had a very,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvery, very long experience with that. And it hasn’t worked. And so\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI’m curious to see how it all plays out. Who knows? Maybe he will\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmake America great again.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Audience member:</strong> Thank you so much for being here.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThere’s been a lot of talk recently about social media acting as an\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\techo chamber that’s feeded into polarization of beliefs. Can you\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcomment on that?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Ana Kasparian:</strong> Absolutely. So I’ll actually talk\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabout it in a more broader sense and how much of an impact it has on\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teveryone regardless of what you’re political ideology is. So in a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tjournalism class that I teach at Cal State Northridge, a lot of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlessons that I discuss is the echo chamber of the Internet.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tParticularly Google. So everytime you’re searching for something on\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGoogle, or every time you go on to one of your favorite websites,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhether it be a conservative website or a liberal website, Google\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tkeeps track of all that information. We know that. And the reason\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey do it is because they want to perfect the algorithm to better\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuit you, so that you’re always exposed to information and content\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat will always appeal to you. But there’s a huge downside to that,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause your entire life becomes an echo chamber. We tend to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tassociate with people we agree with anyway, but the Internet is\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsupposed to be a place where we go, where we have unlimited\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tresources to educate ourselves. We’re supposed to have an open mind\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand be exposed to varying opinions and varying perspectives. And\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGoogle, in its effort to kind of cater to us, has actually deprived\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tus of different perspectives and I think that’s polarizing American\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpolitics even more. And you see it in social media because, again,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twe tend to be friends with people we agree with. But I would argue\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat it’s more important to be open-minded to people that you\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdisagree with. Now again, rhetoric matters, so if we’re attacking\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tone another and we’re calling each other names while we disagree,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat’s only going to further divide us. Look, I’ve been guilty of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat as well, so I’ve got to be honest, but everyone in a while\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tafter my rage relaxes and I tone it down, I try to think about the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconversation I just had and I try to think about whether or not that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tother person had a point. Best example is when I was debating about\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprostitution and whether or not we should legalize it, with Cenk\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUyger, the host of our show. And he’s in favor of legalizing and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tregulating it and at that time, I had bought into the conservative\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpropaganda and I’m like “No! You legalize it and there’s going to be\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprostitutes everywhere!” And we’d gotten into a huge fight about it\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t– I was super stubborn, I wouldn’t agree – I was like “No! You’re\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twrong! You’re wrong! I don’t want to brothels right next to schools!\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIt’s going to be terrible!” And then I started secretly on the down\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlow, doing my own research, like what the pros and cons, what’s\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thappening in other countries that have legalized prostitution. And I\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstarted changing my mind. And all I ask is that we all keep an open\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmind, let’s go out of our way to expose ourselves to the other\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tperspectives.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Audience Member:</strong> If you look at independent,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmedia-based kinds of resources that are customizable, specifically\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Young Turks, you guys target a very much more progressive\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taudience which seems to contribute to this kind of echo-chamber\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teffect, so do you feel that your outlet is at all responsible in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpart for this kind of polarization? How much of the burden of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\totherwise Donald Trump for example, are you willing to take for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tleading to this polarization?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Ana Kasparian:</strong> Yeah, that’s a great question\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tactually. So I would like to do more research into our audience to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfigure out what portion of it does consist of conservatives but we\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshockingly have a lot of conservatives watching the show. And the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treason why that happens, in my opinion, is because we do attack\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDemocrats a lot. Because of the corruption and the politics,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDemocrats and Republicans behave very similarly once they’re elected\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinto office. And so we talk about that a lot, and so, like I said\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tearlier on during my talk when President Obama was elected and we\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstarted criticizing him, people who wanted the echo chamber started\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdropping like flies and it sucked. We felt like we made a lot of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprogress with the show in 2008, like oh, we grew our audience, we\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthought our audience was great and then all of a sudden our\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsubscriber base just dropped. It didn’t just stagnate, all of a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsudden you see a huge dip. And you also saw that dip during this\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\telection when Hillary Clinton was nominated and we had to keep it\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treal with the audience and be like, “Hey, Hillary Clinton is now the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDemocratic nominee.” And we had varying voices and a lot of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdisagreement on our network about whether or not we should vote for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta third party, whether or not we should support Hillary, is it\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbetter to have Trump. And the theory behind that was well if you\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\telect Trump, he’s going to burn the country to the ground and start\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagain. Literally, there were people on our network that have\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheories like that. And so, there was a lot of disagreement on the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\techo chamber, just because we come from a progressive point of view\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdoesn’t mean we totally agree with one another so we really go out\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof our way to make sure we don’t have an echo chamber and I think\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tour audience also reflects that.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Audience member:</strong> I’m a huge fan of your show, and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe feed on Tuesday was one of the few things that kept me sane.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWith the recent subcommittee note on corruption and the Democratic\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tparty, I’m curious about your level of optimism about if the DNC is\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treally able to make some change and allow true progressives who\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taren’t accepting their money to come in and change the Democratic\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tparty?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Ana Kasparian:</strong> So I don’t know if you guys saw, but\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHoward Dean would now like to be the head of the DNC, which I think\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tis not a good idea because he’s a gigantic lobbyist and that’s not\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhat we need. But I think that TYT as an organization is very\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\toptimistic about leading the way to change for the DNC. The DNC is\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvery corrupt. What happened with the primaries, it irates me beyond\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbelief. Like it was the hardest thing to stomach, to see what the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDNC did, to see what Debbie Wasserman-Schultz did in manipulating\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe primaries to ensure that we had a flawed candidate as the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDemocratic nominee and that ultimately led to Trump winning. And so,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhat we want to do is we want to fight and Cenk is a little more\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taggressive in his wording, but he wants to go to war. And a lot of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpeople are like “Oh, it’s a liberal echo chamber,” but we want to go\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto war with liberals, specifically members of the DNC, we want to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchange the DNC and we want to do it aggressively. We want people\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlike Bernie Sanders to be part of the DNC, people who refuse to take\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcorporate money, people who understand that corporate greed is\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunacceptable in a place that’s supposed to function as a democracy.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAnd so, we’re working on a game plan right now, obviously it’s a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvery early for me to give you any details, but we’re going to fight\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand we’re going to fight hard.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Audience member:</strong> I think it’s safe to say that most\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tliberals really did not see the result of this election coming, and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tone cause of this might of course be because of the whole echo\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchamber effect, do you also think that there’s something wrong in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe way we conduct our polling?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Ana Kasparian:</strong> Yes, think that a lot of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\torganizations that do the polling are part of the echo chamber, and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI think that they’re so caught up in their establishment bubble that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey just don’t believe that someone like Donald Trump could ever\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twin the presidency. And so, that bias, I think, impacts their\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmethodology. And there was also the issue of people not being honest\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabout who they’re going to vote for. Or maybe not being honest about\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhether they’re even going to go vote. There are a lot of people who\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdidn’t vote, a lot of members of our electorate who just decided to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstay home and it might be because they were tired of this system\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhere you have to pick the lesser of two evils. You’ve heard that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquite a bit. So I think that if I ever hear Nate Silver or\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFiveThirtyEight again in a credible, legitimate way, I will strangle\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmyself. I don’t know how often you guys watch the show or how\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tregularly you watch the show, but I don’t care about polling. Like I\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcare about it a little bit, to kind of get a sense of what people\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tare thinking, but I don’t put too much weight behind it. There are\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tother members of our show, who love FiveThirtyEight, but I don’t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcare what Nate Silver says. Instead of focusing on polling, why\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdon’t we focus on policy? Policy over polling – that’s what\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\telections should be about. What are these people proposing to do for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tus? Like forget about their character, forget about whether or not\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey’re unsavory. What are you going to do, Donald Trump? What are\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou going to do about foreign policy? “Oh, I’ll let you know when\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI’m elected” – no, that’s not good enough. That’s what we should\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfocus on. So, i think that yes, the pollsters are part of the echo\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchamber, and I think that hopefully, after this election, they\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texperience a little bit of humility and they realize that they need\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto get themselves out of that bubble.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Jackson Rigley:</strong> In fairness to Nate Silver, I think\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twe’d still count him for sports.

The event was moderated by Michael Chien.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Michael Chien</strong>: Professor Zhang, thank you so much\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor taking the time to speak with us here today. I want to begin\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith a topic that has gained national media attention but has been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tespecially discussed here on UC Berkeley’s campus over the last\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmonth, and that’s the relationship between your work and that of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tProfessor Jennifer Doudna’s. Last month, the US Patent and Trademark\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOffice upheld the validity of the Broad Institute’s patent on your\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tresearch and found no interference, in fact, with UC Berkeley’s,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich is still pending. What do you see as the main differences\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbetween your work on CRISPR technology and that of Professor\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDoudna’s?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Feng Zhang</strong>: Thank you for your question. This is a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgood question. So, my understanding is that, we have our patent, and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBerkeley will be issued its patent, and so, we’ll all have patents.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThere will be patents , which is fantastic for the world. And the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthing is, there’s really been a tremendous amount of contribution\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom many different groups. It’s great to see that the different\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontributions getting rewarded and through these different\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmechanisms, and I think it’s really great that all these work will\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe recognized.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Michael Chien</strong>: Well, the patent awarded to the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBroad Institute last month covers the use of CRISPR-cas9 technology\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin eukaryotic environments, but other patents have been submitted\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor use in technology in other environments, like UC Berkeley’s.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThat being said, there are still other institutions, as you\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmentioned, doing their own original research on CRISPR. So, how do\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou think the differences in domain of all these patents, that will\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teventually be filed, affect every institution’s licensing potential?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Feng Zhang</strong>: There are different contributions to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe field. And so these patents will reward or honor these different\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontributions. And I think they will do it appropriately so. In\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tterms of licensing, one thing that we have been doing so far, is to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmake sure that the technology is accessible. In fact, that’s\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsomething we have been trying to do for many years now, and we’re\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgoing to be able to continue to do that, especially with this patent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdecision. The technology is a fundamental, foundational technology.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSo, we want to make sure that as many people have access to that as\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpossible. So, MIT and the Broad Institute have been adopting a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnon-exclusive licensing approach. So, any party, academics, can use\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit freely. Commercial entities can have a nonexclusive license. That\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdoesn’t preclude anybody else from doing it. I think that’s the way\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat we should approach these kinds of technologies. Make it\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccessible. Do not stifle progress, and really enabling as many\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpeople as possible.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Michael Chien</strong>: You spoke very thoroughly about how\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe methodology of your research, and I want to focus a little bit\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmore on the ideation process and the potential applications. As you\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmentioned, the CRISPR-cas9 system was originally discovered in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbacteria, in archaea, which use it to develop immunity through\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstoring the genetic signature of viruses that previously attacked\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit. How did you initially make that connection that this system\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmight be modified for the purpose of gene editing in other\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\torganisms?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Feng Zhang</strong>: So, I had been working on genome\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tediting for a while before I started work on the CRISPR-cas9 system.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSo, there were earlier generations, like I showed on slides, there’s\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsometimes meganucleases. So, when I was a graduate student at\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tStanford, at one time I worked on optogenetics. So optogenetics has\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthree needs that I needed to solve. The first is, how do you get\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tneurons to become light sensitive? And that was done by developing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthese microbial opsin proteins so that we can express the neurons to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconfer light sensitivity. The second challenge was, how do you\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeliver light into the brain when the skull is opaque? So, if you\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tjust shine light the frontal skull, it doesn’t work. So, then I\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeveloped a way to use optical fibers to implant into a specific\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbrain region, and then be able to see into the cells. The third one\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tis, how do you get the opsins to express in a specific group of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcells, not any kind of neuron, only a subset of neurons. So, as a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgraduate student I had developed a ton of different methods to do\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat using either viral vectors or using a crude recombinant system\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith CRE Driver mice to get cell-specific expression. But I really\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twanted to get access to specific cell types in any kind of organism.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMaybe eventually even human for clinical translation. So, when I\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthought about how to do that, one of the things that I thought about\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tis to develop nucleuses to be able to cleave a specific promoter in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe genome, that’s specific to a subtype cell, so that you can\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinsert the opsin genes into that specific genomous region, so that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tis expressed only in the cell that we’re interested in, in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnuclei. When I started to work on CRISPR, after I left Stanford, I\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trealized that these nucleuses are pretty challenging to use. And so\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat’s really problematic. And also, a lot of the reagents were not\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treadily available at the time. So, it’s around that time that I\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstarted to read about other kinds of systems, and I stumbled upon a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsystem called TALE. Transcription activator-like effector. It was in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2010, it was just starting to become understood how TALE proteins\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tare able to recognize DNA sequences. So, I worked on developing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat, and so that turned out to be an efficient system to reprogram\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand recognize specific DNA sequences. So, I started my lab in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeginning of 2011, and I thought maybe I can start using TALE\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsystems to study neurobiology. I can teach students to build them,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand to be able to engineer specific cell types in the brain. But\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat turned out to be quite cumbersome. As I was teaching students\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto build TALEs, I realized that each TALE construction project is\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treally a serious project on its own. And so, if we had to build\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthese complicated systems, it is quite challenging. So, I started to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthink about, are there other systems that you can also use for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treprogrammable genome editing? It was in the beginning of 2011 when\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI just started lab, that I went to a talk at the Broad Institute.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMike Gilmore was a professor there, and he had a talk on his work on\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEnterococcus bacteria. But he had casually mentioned that in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEnterococcus he also find these CRISPR systems. And so, when I heard\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabout CRISPR systems, I didn’t know what it was. And so, I went to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttry to look it up. When I started to look it up on Wikipedia, and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\talso started to read some of the papers, I realized that this is an\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tendonuclease. This is, furthermore, an RNA guided endonuclease. So,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit’s also around that time that Sylvain Moineau from the Laval\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUniversity in Canada, had published a paper in Nature showing that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe cas9 system is an RNA guided single nucleus that can make a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdouble strand breaks inside the bacterial cells. When I saw that, I\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgot really excited. I thought…there’s this new system CRISPR-cas9\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat maybe you can harness to be able to reprogram by just giving it\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta short RNA guide. And so that’s how the idea started. If I wasn’t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthinking about genome editing of nucleuses before, when I heard that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttalk in the beginning of 2011, I probably wouldn’t have realized the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpotential.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Michael Chien</strong>: Well the progression of your\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tresearch, from not only your graduate schooling but all the way up\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tuntil now, has shown immense potential for really curing diseases.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThat being said, there are a lot of ethical implications of this\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tkind of technology. In 2015, researchers at Sun Yat-Sen University\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin China used CRISPR-cas9 technology to edit the genomes of human\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tembryos, which result in genetic changes that are potentially\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\theritable. As a result of your now successful patent, the Broad\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tInstitute has the ability to restrict ethically controversial\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tapplications of this technology. How does the Institute really come\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto decide what types of regulations should be enforced when\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlicensing that technology?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Feng Zhang</strong>: You must have read the licensing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstatement from the Broad Institute. So, one of the things that the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBroad does not provide license for is germline self-editing, exactly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause the controversial issue that’s surrounding the technology.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe other thing that it doesn’t provide license for is the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproduction of survival. So, things that have known health\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsequences for humans. So, the ethical issues surrounding germline\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tediting is a very important issue. And that’s something that has\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen highlighted and also thoroughly discussed. And I think it’s\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsomething that we really need to pay serious attention to, to make\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsure that we are really thinking and understanding these problems\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand doing our best to try to think about ways to be able to move\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforward.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Michael Chien</strong>: Speaking of that licensing agreement\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthough, part of the complicated nature of licensing is the disparity\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin size and intent of all the private companies involved. And so,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Broad Institute has already licensed the technology to Monsanto,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tone of the world’s largest agricultural conglomerates. And UC\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBerkeley has partnered with Dupont Pioneer, a subsidiary of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchemical giant Dupont. Do academic research institutions forfeit\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tautonomy over the direction of their technology’s use when they\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tallow large corporations to use that technology for financial gain?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Feng Zhang</strong>: I think that the most important thing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tis to make sure that foundational technology, like CRISPR-cas9, are\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbroadly distributed. We enable as many people as possible so let\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t1,000 flowers bloom. So many people have created ideas, but each one\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof them not be limited by what they can do, but really enable them\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith all these tools. Broad has licensed to many different companies\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t– we have distributed this to 2,100 laboratories around the world,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treally trying to enable as many people as possible so then they have\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccess to this tool to be able to do what they want to do.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Michael Chien</strong>: In line with that method of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthinking, you’ve also co-founded a company, Editas Medicine, a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstartup dedicated to using CRISPR for gene therapy. Is there a clear\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdelineation between what applications of CRISPR are best suited for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe academic environment versus, say, a corporate research\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenvironment?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Feng Zhang</strong>: I think it’s really great that many\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgroups are actively developing the CRISPR applications. There are\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthings that are developing in clinics by academics, things that are\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeveloped for a clinical application by commercial groups. I think\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit’s really great that many people are so excited about this and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeveloping this to its maximum potential. There are a lot of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchallenges that we still face today with these genome editing tools.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWe need to understand how efficacious it is, how safe it is. Does it\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcause a neurogenic effect when you put it into the body? So, the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmore groups that work on it, I think, the better. There are enormous\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchallenges, and fundamentally, the way that I got excited about the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tresearch partly was motivated by a friend who was sick. I think it’s\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treally important that we keep that in mind. The quicker that we can\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tget to these health solutions, to actually impact the lives of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpatients, the better. So, I think the more groups really, the better\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor the world.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Michael Chien</strong>: For the sake of time, this will be\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmy last question before we turn things over to the audience. My last\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquestion really is about what you said, which is to solve health\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproblems across the world. CRISPR-cas9 has become very notable for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tits potential. In your eyes, probably being one of these individuals\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tclosest to the technology, what do you think is the best-case\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tscenario for curing diseases of all sorts as they impact across all\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlives in this world?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Feng Zhang</strong>: I think CRISPR-cas9 is really just the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeginning of molecular medicine. As we sequence the human genome\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmore, we will understand genetic contribution to this much more.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWe’ll know the mechanisms of these problems a lot more clearly. And\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthen all that will enable us to develop next generation medicine.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCRISPR is also enabling researchers to accelerate their research.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDrug companies can now screen and validate drugs with a fraction of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe time that it used to take them. And all of these combined\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttogether I think is going to make a huge impact on the future of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmedicine.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Audience Member</strong>: Hi Professor Zhang. I have a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquestion regarding the C2c2 enzyme you mentioned just now. Did you\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tobserve any off targeted effect for the C2c2, and if there is any\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\toff target effect, how sensitive, or how specific it is for the RNA\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat you wanted to target?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Feng Zhang</strong>: In some of [way, it’s] very similar to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcas9 or Cpf1. The way you increase the number of these batches and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthen it becomes quite specific. And I think just like the way we’re\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\table to engineer the cas9 to make it more specific by reducing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnon-specific interactions, we’ll push it out to be able to make C2c2\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teven more specific.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Audience Member</strong>: Hi Professor.

I think there are a lot of ideas like this, and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit’s thought provoking. But I think in practice, is actually pretty\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchallenging to realize that.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Audience Member</strong>: Hi Professor.

So, I followed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyour collaborators, the Broad’s Ramnik Xavier. And in an age where\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tautoimmune disease and a lot of chronic diseases, not just DNA the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhole philosophy of nature versus nurture. What are your general\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthoughts on the microbiome and therapeutics within that area, and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhere you see things being malleable with regard to microbiome?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Feng Zhang</strong>: I think microbiome is really an\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texciting area. There is actually a lot of really interesting\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tresearch being done here in California that highlights the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\timportance of micro biomes for a variety of different health\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsequences: Alzheimer’s disease or Parkinson’s disease, autism\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teven. And we don’t know enough about what the interactions of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmicrobiome in the body is. Is it entirely going through the immune\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsystem, or is it also direct interface with the nervous system in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe body? I think it’s very exciting. And I think it’s a very\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpowerful direction to be able to develop new categories of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttherapeutics. And as already being shown to be very efficacious for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsome diseases.

I think you also have to be a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trealist. You have to start with the ones that are tractable. And so\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tright now, tractability is defined by areas that we can have\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tefficient delivery. Mutation types that we can have high\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tefficiencies in correction. And I think if you go through the list\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand evaluate based on those criteria, you will find that blood\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdisorders are probably things that are tractable right now. And so,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlike sickle cell disease or beta thalassemia, and also eye diseases\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tor ear, hearing diseases, are areas that are tractable to deliver.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Audience Member</strong>: Hello Professor.

And then my second question would be,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhere do you see the future of the field genetics?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Feng Zhang</strong>: Thank you. These are tough questions.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhere’s my lab going to go? I think for one thing is where we are\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvery actively working on trying to address challenges that face the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgenome editing technologies, especially with translating this into\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttherapeutic applications. Making the enzyme more specific. Making\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe editing mechanism more robust. And also working on delivery\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tapproaches that makes it possible to target more tissues beyond just\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta system or the other. In terms of the field of genetics, I think we\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tare in a renaissance for genetics. There are so many exciting\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdiscoveries. So many model technologies that all converging right\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnow. And that’s really making our understanding of genetic\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontributions of any process disease or non-disease much more likely\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto be addressed. And I think in the next 10 years, we’ll learn so\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmuch. It’s hard to predict how far we’ll be. Certainly, 10 years ago\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpredicting where genetics is today would be difficult to make an\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccurate prediction. So, I think in 10 years, I think diseases will\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe treatable, some diseases. And we will know a lot more and we will\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe able to develop more personalized mechanism-based therapeutics of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tso many health problems.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Audience Member</strong>: Hi Dr Zhang. Thanks for coming to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBerkeley and thanks to Forum for organizing this event. We all\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunderstand that CRISPR technology should be promoted as much as\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpossible in that academic field. But from the commercial\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tperspective, so if there was a start-up company that wants to use\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis technology, what kind of licensing agreement would this company\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto do with the public company or the research institute in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfield? Does the start-up only need to do one, or if problem is to do\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tseveral licensing agreements with the different institutes?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Feng Zhang</strong>: I think what we’re trying to do at MIT\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand Broad is, we’re trying to make the technology as accessible as\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpossible. So, we are non-exclusively licensing it to anybody who\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twants to come in and get a license. And so, whether you are a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstart-up company or you’re a Fortune 50 company or you’re an\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tacademic course facility, you get the same treatment to get access\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto the technology.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Audience Member</strong>: Hello Professor Zhang. I was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcurious. Recently, there’s been a huge push for genomic, genetic, I\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tguess, general nucleic acid based technologies and solutions to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdisease. Do you see that as a be all, end all? Or do you think that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas we’re exploring these, there’s going to be a combination of that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand, maybe, some other approaches that are going to be required to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsolve these diseases?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Feng Zhang</strong>: When we’re thinking a multiple-choice\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquestion, usually it’s A, B, C, or all of the above. Usually, all of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe above is a good guess to choose. So, absolutely. Genomics\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tapproaches is a very powerful approach. Or vary so much from these\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgenetic sequencing or genetic analysis approaches of that disease.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBut that’s probably not going to be everything. We need other\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmethodologies. And I think that’s where interdisciplinary approaches\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat combine sophisticated computation with chemistry with physical\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmethods, and also all of the different arrays of biological\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinterrogation of this. Conversion, then, is going to be critical for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tus to make a huge push.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t</Container>\r\n\t\t\t<Footer />\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t);\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default RandPaul;\r\n","import React from 'react';\r\n\r\nimport '../../css/Blog.scss';\r\nimport Header from '../A-WebElements/Header';\r\nimport Footer from '../A-WebElements/Footer';\r\n\r\nimport Container from 'react-bootstrap/Container';\r\nimport Row from 'react-bootstrap/Row';\r\n\r\nconst RandPaul = () => {\r\n\treturn (\r\n\t\t<div className=\"conversations\">\r\n\t\t\t<Header name=\"blog\" />\r\n\t\t\t<Container fluid className=\"blog-content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<div className=\"header-none\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2>2019 Crowdfunding Campaign Update</h2>\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p className>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOn behalf of all of the student members of the Berkeley Forum, a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmassive thank you to all of those who donated.

What’s your process for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcoming up with these questions in the first place?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Michael Stevens:</strong> It really comes from something I\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\theard that I cannot understand. I can’t wrap my head around. For\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinstance, that orange peel thing, I was like, “Why four?” And I\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttalked to a mathematician, he said: “Well, it’s true of any convex\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsolid.” You have to take the average though, like, I don’t know, he\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttook a cube. A cube can have a shadow that’s a square or an octagon\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tor anything in between, but if you average all those areas they will\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\talways be a quarter of its surface area. And then my next question\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tis “Why? Can I explain it even to, like, a child?” And the answer is\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\talways yes. Anyone can always understand anything, sometimes it just\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttakes more words. But the key is to always make sure that you\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\toverestimate your audience’s intelligence. They’re super smart and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey’re curious to learn deeply, but you want to underestimate their\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvocabularies. Meaning, you can’t just use words, you can’t just\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthrow a word out there and say that’s the answer, it’s because of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinertia. “Well, what’s inertia?” “It’s because of, like, you know,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmath.” “But why? Like, why do the angles all add up to that number?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLike, why isn’t the universe different? Why is the speed of light\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe fastest anything can go, who decided that?” And so, I keep\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twanting to go deeper and deeper and playing that, sort of, childish\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgame of ‘But why, why?’\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong> Hersh Bhargava:</strong> You mentioned in your talk a few\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tminutes ago that some of the questions that you want to ask are so\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tobscure that there’s not even a Wikipedia page to start from. How do\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou in many of your topics with no formal educational background,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmanage to delve into such detail on topics that even the people who\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tare in that space haven’t yet created the Wikipedia page for?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Michael Stevens:</strong>I just hope to do some justice to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit. Like, I’m not an expert. I don’t even consider myself a teacher.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tA teacher has a much harder job. They have to show up, like, early.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAnd their students mandatorily have to be there by law. You know?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhereas, I can…I can spend as much time as I want in the topic that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI want to talk about. And a lot of it comes down to speaking with\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texperts and reading as many explanations that I can. Until I’ve\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tworked my way up to the actual…the rigorous explanations. And once I\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcan understand them, then I know that I’m ready to go back to the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeginning and explain it at a level that doesn’t necessarily need\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor knowledge of all of the symbols and the words. So, with, like,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBanack Tarski, I couldn’t even find a mathematician that could\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texplain it, so, I just met with a mathematician at the Brit Lab,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tYoutube channel and just, like, presented the video to her, like,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlive, and she was able to follow it and I said “Okay, print.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThat’s…that will be the script I guess.” But it’s some…it takes\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforever and I think a lot of people don’t understand why it takes so\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlong because I’m, kind of, like a vlogger in some ways. But, it’s\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot like I turn on the camera and I just know it all. It took me\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tweeks or months and it took me lots of versions and lots of trials\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand lots of conversations and reading to get to that point. Like, I\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tonly have that one book with me because I need to read it in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpreparation for today, but I have a stack of relativity books and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey all say things in different ways. But the more ways you hear\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsomeone explain something the more likely you are to finally get it\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tintuitively. You need all those different voices, not one person,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut different people with different backgrounds who have approached\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit with different backgrounds to say “Here’s how I would explain\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit.”\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<br></br>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<br></br>[audience laughing]\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Hersh Bhargava:</strong> Even if you don’t consider yourself\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta teacher, your content is both entertaining as well as educational,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tessentially across the board.

However,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit’s not always the same kind of learning that is narrowly defined\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin school. Like, you might love sports facts and looking at\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstatistics and the history of the team. You might love your favorite\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tband. You know everything about drummers were used, where they’ve\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tplayed. That’s curiosity as well. But it’s not the kind you get\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttested on or get, you know, on the SAT or whatever. You can’t…you\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdon’t come across like you’re some kind of, smart person if you’re\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinto that. But everyone’s got something that they’re really\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpassionate about, that they define themselves by, they want to learn\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabout it. And, so, I just try to find ways to hook in as many people\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas possible. And maybe you don’t care about Rayleigh scattering but\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou do care about why the sky is blue and how that’s related to why\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tblue eyes are blue.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Hersh Bhargava:</strong> So, there’s this recent phenomenon\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tknown as binge-watching and people binge watch your videos, but\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou’ll never see people binge-watching their CS lectures.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t[audience laughing]\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Hersh Bhargava:</strong> Or maybe almost never.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Michael Stevens:</strong> Challenge accepted. <br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t[audience laughing]\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Hersh Bhargava:</strong> Do you think that there are\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttechniques that you use to make your content so captivating that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcould be leveraged by people who love to teach in more didactic\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenvironments?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Michael Stevens:</strong> That’s a really good question and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI think it’s hard to answer because I’m just doing what I do. I\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thaven’t, like, planned out some kind of strategy. When I think back\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto the, like, high school days of doing informative speaking, I\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlearned a lot about chill bump moments. Okay? These are moments\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhere you say something significant, the audience wants to, like,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twrite down and tell their friends and family later to make\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthemselves look smarter, funny or whatever. And, kind of, have a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcertain density with those and every topic has them.

You started essentially when you were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tour age, in college making these videos. Was there a point where you\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trealized that this was going to be your full-time job, that this was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgoing to be where you, at least, so far will have left your legacy?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Michael Stevens:</strong> So, two answers. One, I really\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdidn’t cover the fact that in, like, 2011, a company acquired Next\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNewNetworks and that company was Google. Yeah. So, I was a Google\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\temployee for about four or five years. They owned VSauce. And it was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta really bizarre, kind of, thing that was not common in Google\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tobviously. They were starting to fund original content but no one at\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tYoutube had ever made a Youtube video. So, they booked Next New\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNetworks that made successful content and also very family friendly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontent and said, “We’re going to acquire you. And you guys are\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgoing to be called the Next Lab. And you’re going to just, like,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thave all this knowledge about how to make videos. You’re going to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thelp our clients make better content. Along with that acquisition,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tVSauce was part of it. But VSauce was really small at that time. So,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit was only my part-time job. My real job was to be a strategist who\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould sit down with the BBC or with, you know, UEFA and talk to them\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabout how to make, you know, get more views basically. But as VSauce\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrew it became more obvious that focusing on that would be my job.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSo, I never had that nervous moment of how am I going to make ends\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmeet because I was employed by other a big company and there was so\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmany benefits that went along with that, I didn’t have to worry\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabout sponsors. I didn’t have to worry about releasing content fast\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenough that I was making enough money from the ads. I could just\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmake things that I wanted to. And I had some pressure. You know, I\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcouldn’t not do my job. But the only time it became a problem was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhen we wanted to grow faster and I couldn’t just say “Hey, Google,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI want a team of ten people. I want to budget of millions of dollars\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto make this big show, big experiments.” They’d be like,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t“That’s…we’re a tech company. What are you talking about?” But then\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlast year, in January, VSauce became independent. So, it hasn’t even\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen that long. It’s been like a year and a half. So, now VSauce is\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton its own and we can do things like create the Minefield show.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Hersh Bhargava:</strong> In the interest of time this is\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgoing to my last question before we transition into the audiences Q\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand A portion of our event.

There’s no evidence that it is. But what\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdoes it mean to know the truth of something? But what’s weird is\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat when you get into that, kind of, territory, you come across\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlike maybe you support flat Earthers, right? When in reality, what\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI’m trying to do is talk about what can science do? Why is it our\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbest way of knowing? There are other ways to know things, but\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tscience is the one that allows us to predict and explain things that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdoesn’t contradict itself, that works over and over again. And so, I\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tguess…I just want to keep…I want…I think more people need to learn\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe history of science and the philosophy behind what we do. Because\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas soon as you start saying “Hey, science is right whether you\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbelieve in it or not.” Well, that’s not the point of science at all.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tYou know, it’s all about trying to improve itself. And it’s not\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsomething that you just accept. It’s our best way of knowing. So,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tanyway, I guess that’s, kind of, a vague abstract answer. But, you\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tknow, I’m always trying to touch on that and it, kind of, goes along\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith the, “But what is water?” You know? Where I’m going, “But wait\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta second, like, what does it mean to say the Earth is round? Like,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhat about this explanation? What about this one?” They all seem to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twork but “Ooh, they contradict each other. Interesting.” And I think\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat when you teach the controversy, you’ll almost always push\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpeople in the direction of what science has found. But when you\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tignore all the challenges, then…I don’t know, people don’t seem as\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconvinced.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Hersh Bhargava:</strong> Well, thank you so much for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tanswering my questions.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Michael Stevens:</strong> Thank you.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t[audience laughing]\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Hersh Bhargava:</strong> So for the remainder of our time,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twe’re going to take questions from the audience.

And, so, what I’m trying\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto get at is, you know, we have prototypical sandwiches, right?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLike, a BLT, a PB and J. Two slices of bread with stuff in between.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhat about an Oreo, it’s a sandwich cookie, okay? What about when\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou’re sandwiched between two people in an airplane seat? That’s not\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe sandwich that you eat but the sandwich word still applies. So,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhat I’m trying to say is that a hot dog is somewhere over here,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhereas the BLT is here. It’s called…what’s the name for that? It’s\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlike contrastive reduplication. When you repeat a word to mean a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprototypical example. So, I don’t want to take a whole bunch of time\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut, when you say something like, “Oh, yeah, we went out on a date\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut it wasn’t like a date, date.” What you’re saying is you say the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tword date twice that’s reduplication to contrast it with fringe\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tversions. “Okay, it was a date, but it wasn’t, like, the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstereotypical date, date. A penguin is a bird. That’s not like a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbird, bird.”So, a hot dog is a sandwich but it’s not a sandwich,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsandwich. It’s pretty close and we get the similarities but when we\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tget hung up on, it’s either one thing or the other, we get ourselves\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinto trouble.

One of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe things I’m the most proud of is an episode on ‘Why animals don’t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thave wheels,’ right? Because wheels are so simple.

And, anyway, the, kind of, short answer is that in order\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor a wheel work you need to have roads. You need to have a species\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat will say “Hey, guys, let’s build flat areas that we’ll all\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbenefit from.” And only do humans have that, kind of, cooperative\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsense. Anyway, in that entire episode, I never once said the word\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tevolution. I just talked about how “Look, if you’ve…if you grow a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthing that’s not connected to your body, it’s going to die off. So,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou’re not going to probably live long enough to have…to reproduce.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSo, anything that had a wheel is just not going to be around.” And\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teveryone gets that. Even if you think evolution is, like, this\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdangerous thing.

In that book I showed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou the Epstein Relativity book, he’s got a side note where he’s\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlike, “By the way, science is a religion.” Like, we have to have\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfaith that our measurements are correct. We have to have faith that,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlike, the ratio between a diameter and a circumference is Pi because\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit really isn’t. I mean, spacetime is curved. Spacetime might not be\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinfinitely divisible, so, you’re never going to get a perfect\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcircle.

You have\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto discuss one of these 12 themes and you have to start with a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tparagraph that’s like a funnel, it starts big and it gets narrow.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSo, every one of my papers began with “Ever since the dawn of time\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmany have wondered what order is.

Like,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teveryone says when you’re young in college take all the things\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou’re required to first so, that you don’t have to worry about them\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhen you’re a senior. I did the opposite. I took all the ridiculous,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlike, Spinoza’s Ethics taught by a visiting professor philosopher,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tright? And I didn’t take any of the, you know, general ed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trequirements or any of those things until the very last minute. And\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI was so glad I did because I was forced to be surrounded by the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsmartest people and then by the end of my college time when I was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstarting to work more on the Youtube stuff, I had easier classes.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSo, I was like so smart.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t[audience laughing]\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Michael Stevens:</strong> Anyway, your question is not being\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tanswered by me at the moment. Okay, so…yeah, the…this philosopher\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvisiting professor told me “Your thesis statement just needs to be\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsomething that’s not trivial.” Saying that this thing represents\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\torder everyone said. Say something crazy. And I realized “Oh, you\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmean I get to do what I want to do.” As long as I can back it up and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas long as it’s interesting and fascinating and leads to all kinds\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof conversations, that’s what it should be. And it’s…it was the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpeople I met in the way of thinking and the ideas I was introduced\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto that mattered. I did not go to college to get a certain job. Many\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpeople do and that’s perfect.

I mean, Youtube\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdoes an auto-play thing, which its recommendations are getting\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbetter and better. But it is weird, right? Like, we didn’t use to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twatch this much content. There just wasn’t even that much. And I\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdon’t think it’s a bad thing at all. I think this is just a new\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthing that’s going to happen to our species. I mean, Socrates was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treally worried about writing. We know from what Plato said he said\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat he was like “Writing? This is a terrible invention. It means\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat people don’t remember things. They trust the written word and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot their own minds.” Well, guess who’s got egg on his face now,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tright?

It’s like, “Well, what’s going to happen in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfuture?” I’m like, “It’s already happened. We’re already displacing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmore and more of what this thing does to other things. We’re already\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlike, spending a lot of time on the internet. I did a thing about\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe friend zone, have you guys seen it? Sounds like it would be this\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treally annoying topic. Like “Oh, my gosh. Is he going to say that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe friend zone is some, like, you know, “Well, you’re owed, love.”\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tInstead, I was, like, “Guys, guys, friends is more important than\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tever…” being friends because now we’re able to connect with people\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton the internet who believe exactly what we believe. And that’s\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhat…that’s the one thing that worries me, that I…I’m not forced to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeal with, like, “Oh, my neighbors have completely different belief\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin things than I do.” Doesn’t have to happen that way anymore. I can\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tjust stay on the internet, only hear what I want to hear, and I can\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlive in a location and country where everyone agrees with me. And\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthen a long time ago, when people weren’t as, you know, didn’t move\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas much, when you couldn’t be connected as much, you really would,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlike, go bowling every Tuesday night with five people who all\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdisagreed on things. And you were forced to talk with them and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprivately hate them.

And I was personally, very surprised,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat you went down, personally, to talk with those individuals\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\toutside. Of course, it wasn’t a very fruitful discussion. So, for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tindividuals who are very impassioned, and very concerned, about the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tactions of your department, how do you, and how does your\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdepartment, communicate a lot of the misinformation, and a lot of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe numbers, if they’re so unwilling to listen?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Jeh Johnson</strong>: Well, discussions like this, for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texample, on college campuses. I have spoken at the Heritage\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFoundation. I’ll go anyplace to have a conversation, and a dialogue.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAnd what I’d say to young people, who feel impassioned about the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tissue, and want to make a lot of noise about the issue, I respect,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand admire, and support your enthusiasm, and your commitment to the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tissues. Now, let’s channel that, in a way that can bring about\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchange. Take my advice, on how to best put the pressure points on\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe system, to bring about change. Here are the people you need to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttalk to, here are the people you need to influence. I’m all for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\timmigration reform. I’d like to see us deport fewer people, and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfocus more on the criminals, because that’s where our resources\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshould be. Not just going after the people who are easiest to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tapprehend, but spending the time to look for the threats to public\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsafety. That’s the smartest investment of our taxpayer money, and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twe’re not breaking up families. So, I’m all for immigration reform.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI’m all for Congress passing comprehensive immigration reform, that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprovides for an earned path to citizenship, for those who are\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tundocumented. Now, let’s talk to the people who are not, and see if\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twe can change some minds. And there are ways in Washington, and in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSacramento, and elsewhere, to do that, in an effective way. And so I\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlearned this from the repeal of Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell, in 2010. In\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tJanuary, 2010, when I was General Counsel of DoD, the Secretary of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDefense, Bob Gates, asked me to do a study, on whether or not the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmilitary was ready to repeal Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell, along with an\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tArmy 4-star general. So, we spent 10 months doing this, and we made\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tour report public. We surveyed 400,000 people, we visited military\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbases all around the country, in groups this size, we probably hit\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover 50 bases. Everyone we spoke to had an opinion about gays in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmilitary. Everyone. This wasn’t an issue where people said, “Well, I\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdon’t really know.” And so a lot of people in Congress… And it\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trequired repealing a law, from 1993. A lot of people in Congress\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere firmly in one camp or another, but there was that swing vote,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthere were people in the middle, who hadn’t made up their minds. And\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tso that’s who I knew I had to target our report at, the people who\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twanted to listen, and the people who could be influenced, one way or\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tanother, by a thorough, exhaustive study. And we made our report\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpublic, on November 30, 2010, and the Congress repealed Don’t Ask,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDon’t Tell, three weeks later. Frankly, it was an idea whose time\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad come. But with the advocates for repeal out there, working in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Congress, to influence the votes, that really didn’t make a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdifference, and it was smart policy change. And it would be great if\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twe could marshall that kind of thing, because there’s a lot of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenergy out there, to marshall that kind of thing, when it comes to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\timmigration reform.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Carter Keeling:</strong>: You mentioned, four days ago,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t9/11, was your birthday.

So, I\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tjust want to say hi, Secretary Johnson…. I just want to thank you\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor coming to Berkeley. It’s fantastic having you here. Glad you’re\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgetting to see the passionate student body we have here. So, the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquestion I had originally planned to ask you, you’ve already touched\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tupon pretty well. It was a question about the specific strategies\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat your department’s using to prevent lone wolf terrorism,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tespecially after the Chattanooga shootings. So, I guess I’d just\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlike to ask you if you could go over some more of the specific\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstrategies, if you’re at liberty to, and also leading one of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfederal entities that’s been given specific abilities under the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPatriot Act.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Jeh Johnson</strong>: Well, let me give you two specific\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texamples, of what we can and should do, and what we are doing, in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe current environment. Number one, in July, I announced security\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenhancements, to what is referred to as our visa waiver program.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThere are 38… Can everybody hear me? There are 38 countries, for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich we do not require a visa, to come here to this country. We\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thave added security assurances, that we expect to get from those\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcountries, with respect to people who travel here. So, we want those\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcountries to participate to a greater degree in the Interpol Stolen\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPassport database. Put passports into Interpol, report them when\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey’re stolen. We want more flights that include federal air\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarshals from these countries. We want more sharing, we want them to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdevelop, and use advanced passenger information, so that they know\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho are getting on flights, in their countries, like we do in this\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcountry. So, greater security assurances, with respect to countries\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom which people travel without a visa, to deal, frankly, with the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tphenomenon of foreign fighters. All these people who are leaving\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcountries, and on occasion, this country, to go to Iraq and Syria to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttake the fight. So, that’s one thing. I mentioned before, countering\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tviolent extremism. So, one of the things that we can and should do,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand we are doing, is encouraging communities to prevent and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinterdict, before it becomes a matter of law enforcement. A lot of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpeople that the FBI arrest are very young people, younger than you.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAnd so we want to encourage work with communities, give them support\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhere necessary, to intervene, and interdict, before somebody\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdecides they want to pick up, and get on a flight, and travel to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSyria. So, those are two examples. One of the things that I also\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twant to do, and that we are doing, we’re building more of, is\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsomething called pre-clearance capability, overseas. If you get on a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tflight from Amsterdam, to the United States, for example, you’ll see\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe customs capability, once we make this arrangement, at the front\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tend, not the back end. Passengers actually like it, because when you\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tget off that 8-hour plane ride, the first thing you want to do, is\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thop in the Uber, or the taxi. You don’t want to sit around, in a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlong line, waiting to be asked a lot of questions, by my customs\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tofficers. Do it on the front end, when you’re fresh, and we know\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmore about somebody, before they get on the airplane. So, that’s the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttype of direction we’re moving in. We’re also more sophisticated,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand better at connecting the dots, among our interagency, and we\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twant to do the same, with our good counterterrorism partners\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\toverseas, with respect to individuals of suspicion. Okay. Next\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquestion.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Audience Member</strong>: Hi, Secretary Johnson. And my\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquestion is in response to the refugee crisis in Europe and the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMiddle East, Germany has promised entrance of 800,000 refugees,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tVenezuela, 20,000 refugees, and only a couple days ago, did Obama\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpromise 10,000 refugees could make their home here. And I’m\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twondering why has there been such hesitancy, and what are you and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyour department going to do to speed up the process, for the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trefugees coming here, so they don’t have to wait two years in limbo,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgoing through the process of entering a country.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Jeh Johnson</strong>: A couple of things. First, in addition\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto accepting 10,000 Syrian refugees, the United States government\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\talready provides billions of dollars in humanitarian assistance, to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe refugee problem right now, something like 4 billion. We’re the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbiggest single donor to that effort overseas. So, that’s one thing.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWe also have… We’ve got Central America, and we’ve got Mexico. So,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas I’ve mentioned before, something like 330,000 apprehensions on\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tour Southern border, many of whom will apply for asylum in this\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcountry. I have a finite number of CIS personnel, that can be\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdevoted to screening for asylum, and screening for refugee status.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAnd when you do screening for refugees, they have to go overseas, to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tplaces like Iraq, or Jordon, or other places, in border countries.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThey have to go overseas to do this screening, which means diverting\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem away from a lot of other immigration services. The other thing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabout CIS, United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, which\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tis responsible for refugee screening, it is a fee-based\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\torganization. It pays for itself through fees, applications,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tapplication fees, for green cards, and so forth. So, it’s got to pay\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor itself, and refugees is not a fee-based activity. So, you’ve got\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto pay for the refugee screening we do, through fees coming from\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tother types of services. So, we want to do more, we will do more, by\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tway of refugees, by way of direct humanitarian assistance, with our\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdollars, and we want to do it as quickly as possibly, but like\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teverything in government, you’ve got to do it with the resources\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat you have. Right now, as I said, Congress has yet to pass a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbudget for 2016, and unless they affirmatively repeal it,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsequestration… Everybody knows what sequestration is, right?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSequestration is going to kick back in at the beginning of next\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcalendar year, which decapitates my budget. So, lots of times,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpeople want us to do more, but you’ve got to give me more to do it\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith. And I can’t do more with less. So, if we have to live with\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsequestration, we have to cut back on immigration services, border\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsecurity, law enforcement, counterterrorism, aviation security,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcybersecurity, Coast Guard, maritime security. We’re still feeling\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe effects from sequestration, two years ago. So, that is my plea\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto this room. Support repeal of sequestration, so we can do more, of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe types of things, that folks here on this campus want us to do. I\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thave time for one more question. Yes, sir. Right here.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Audience Member</strong>: Ah, yes. So, you’ve spoken a lot\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabout counterterrorism, and the rising threat of lone wolves, and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsimilar effects that are totally unexpected, and so understandably\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou’ve… I mean, I’m not privy to the surveillance methods, or\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdifferent mechanism that you try and anticipate such attacks, or try\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand prevent them before they occur, but are there mechanisms that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou have in place, to ensure that you’re not overstepping, so as to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinfringe upon civil liberties?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Jeh Johnson</strong>: Yes. Yes. Unlike the Department of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDefense, where I used to work, the Department of Homeland Security\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thas an Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, and an Office of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPrivacy, that reports directly to me, that is privy to the most\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsensitive Homeland Security programs we have, that provides exactly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat type of balance. And I hear from them directly. They sit in on\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tall the most sensitive meetings, to ensure that we’re not crossing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthose lines, that we’re not profiling people by race, religion, skin\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcolor, and the like, that we’re not crossing the lines, in terms of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinhibiting travel, and so forth. And that’s something that I\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpersonally believe we absolutely, we have to do. Actually, I do want\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto say one more thing. To the students here. When I was in college,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI wanted to be in public service, politics. I wanted to be in public\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tservice, and I never lost that dream. I went to law school, I got\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsucked into the Wall Street corporate law thing for a while, but I\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnever lost the dream of public service. And so I came back to it,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI’ve been four times in public service. As a federal prosecutor, as\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGeneral Counsel of the Air Force, General Counsel of DoD, and now\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis job, which I never imagined I would be in. And it’s been great\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tevery moment, there is never a dull day in my job. And I have, in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpublic service, way more to talk about at parties, than I did at my\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprivate corporate law practice. And the basic instinct of all of us\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tis to serve, and to help people, which is what you do most often in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpublic service. So, those of you students who are thinking about a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcareer in public service, at the state, local, or federal level,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdon’t lose that dream. I hope it stays with you. Even with the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmortgage, with the kids, the dog, the tuitions, the student debt.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDon’t lose that dream. I haven’t. I made a lot more money in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcorporate law. Right now, I make less than probably a third year\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tassociate, three years out of law school, at my law firm in New\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tYork, Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton, and Garrison. I run an\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\torganization of 240,000 people. I make less than a third year\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tassociate, but I would not exchange it for anything in the world.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSo, thank you all very, very much.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t</Container>\r\n\t\t\t<Footer />\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t);\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default RandPaul;\r\n","import React from 'react';\r\n\r\nimport '../../css/Blog.scss';\r\nimport Header from '../A-WebElements/Header';\r\nimport Footer from '../A-WebElements/Footer';\r\n\r\nimport Container from 'react-bootstrap/Container';\r\nimport Row from 'react-bootstrap/Row';\r\n\r\nconst Lineup = () => {\r\n\treturn (\r\n\t\t<div className=\"conversations\">\r\n\t\t\t<Header name=\"blog\" />\r\n\t\t\t<Container fluid className=\"blog-content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<div className=\"header-2020lineup\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2>Introducing the Berkeley Forum’s Spring 2020 Lineup</h2>\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The Berkeley Forum Announces Spring 2020 Event Lineup </p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>January 21, 2020</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBERKELEY, California ― Today, the Berkeley Forum announced that it\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thas confirmed 13 events for its Spring 2020 lineup, which includes\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttalks, debates, and panels featuring leaders from various fields and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdisciplines.

Why did you decide to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbreak out from the norm [and] start Axios, instead of staying in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPOLITICO and maybe changing the rules of the game from within?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Jim VandeHei</strong>: Everything in life, there’s lots of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treasons. One, I’m restless. I like to do new things. I would say I\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgot addicted to starting companies or starting products when I was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat POLITICO. I think I’m decent at it, so I wanted to give it\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tanother whirl. The big one, though, is I saw an opportunity. An\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\topportunity, and with the way I look at businesses, now that we\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstart them, is you’ve got to have, what is a need that needs to be\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfilled? If you can fill that need, is there a plausible way to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmonetization of that idea? To me, the challenge now is different\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthan when we started POLITICO. POLITICO, at the time, all it was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfilling to me was this need for more political coverage, more depth,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith more analysis, hooked up to the web, taking advantage of cable\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTV. Our belief was that, that was what Washington needed, and our\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheory was that if Washington needed, anybody who cared about\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpolitics would ultimately get sucked into it. Mission accomplished.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe new challenge, I’d say, for all of us is the one I outlined up\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthere, which is the world is more complex today than it was a decade\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tago, and it’s going to get exponentially more complex, and that for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpeople who care about serious news consumption, and I do believe\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat’s still a nice chunk of the country and a really nice chunk of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe world, there has to be a better, more efficient way for people\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto have a fuller understanding of politics, technology, business,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmedia consumption which is not Katie Couric’s contract, it’s a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdissemination in consumption of information, but science, future of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twork, and so if you look at, if you go to Axios, those are our\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsections. Every one of the sections that we have are issues that are\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgoing to shape the future, all narrated by people who have expertise\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand following. We have what we call a radiate theory, that if we’re\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpretty good at getting Jamie Dimon as a reader, the president as a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treader, or Sheryl Sandberg as a reader, then our theory is we can\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twrite stuff that they find essential, that ultimately that will echo\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tout to anybody else who cares about it. The early results are very\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tencouraging. People respond very well to it, and the neatest thing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tis, we do reader surveys. We sent one out maybe three months in. We\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsent it out, and we didn’t have that big a readership at the time. I\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthink 12,000 people filled it out. It took 15 minutes, 6,000\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvolunteered to answer any question we ever have, and it was so\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinteresting to read it, because people were responding to it using\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlanguage that we would use inside of our meetings. Say, “Oh, you’re\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thelping me get smarter faster.” Oh, you’re making the reading of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcomplex issues more efficient, more understandable, more\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tapproachable. This is easy to read, easy to share. It’s clean. Those\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthings are super gratifying. It’s a long way of answering that there\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas an opportunity that we saw to fill. I believe that we’re filling\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit, and now I actually think this could be exponentially bigger than\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twe even thought when we launched it nine months ago. That’s to me\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tone of the most astonishing things. We just launched nine months\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tago, and I knew we were on to something when two months in the New\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tYork Times was quoting Axios without saying what it is. I was like,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t“Come on.” Two months in, as a new publication, and at least for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpeople in the media, people in politics, people in technology, that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey were that familiar with it, that they assumed their readership\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas familiar with it. I know that a lot of people aren’t familiar\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith it, so it probably should’ve explained what it was, and then\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsaid Axios.com.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Michael Chien:</strong> When you talk about, one of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tresounding motifs of your address was this trust in specific that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe media and journalism is now operating in.

One is, we hire\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpeople who are already respected in their area, so Mike Allen in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpolitics, Dan Primack who is probably the most respected writer on\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tventure capital. Kim Hart, who’s probably the most respected writer\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton the collision of technology and Washington. Sara Fischer, who\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcovers media trends. You hire people who already command respect and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommand a certain following. Then, you create a culture that demands\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat we’re there to write information. We don’t have an opinion\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpage. You’re not allowed to pop off on Twitter with your opinion or\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton any social media, whether you’re on the business side or the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teditorial side, because we all have a responsibility. Everybody at\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tour company is an owner. Every person has stock and will forever in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe company, so that they feel a sense of ownership, because Axios\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich is Greek means worthy. Worthy of your trust, worthy of your\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttime. They have a responsibility. If you treat people like adults in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta workplace, they’ll respond like adults. If you put weird\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trestrictions on them, they’ll act like toddlers and throw their\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlittle toys.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Michael Chien:</strong> Is that a mission that appeals to, I\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tguess, the almost half of Americans who don’t really see the media\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas producing trustworthy content or even see it as a viable option\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof their own information edification?

Listen,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthere’s a big segment of the country that’s never going to. I can’t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmake people care. I just can’t, but I can make the experience for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpeople who want to care or who do care way better. It is, some of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe people who thought fake news is fake news. Yeah, sure. We\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdefinitely hear from, we’ve got a nice ideological breakdown in our\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treadership. I think people do trust us, because we are very\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tclinical. We’re trying to explain what’s happening and why it’s\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thappening. That’s it. Every story, every item, if you go on the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAxios screen, what is new, what is interesting, and why does it\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmatter? Why does it matter? How should I think about this, based on\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsomebody who spent their lifetime thinking about this topic, and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeing in conversations with the people who spend the rest of their\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlife thinking about this topic? Those are the only things I know\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat you can do to earn trust, and then when you’re on TV, doing the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinterview like I am here. Not betraying an ideological bias, and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thaving an authenticity about yourself as a publication, and I think\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcollectively if you had any of the other people at Axios here, they\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould hopefully sound a lot like me. You would say they’re\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tauthentic, they care, they’re in it for the right reasons. They’re\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttrying their best, and knowing we’re not always going to get it\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tright. We’re going to screw stuff up. We just are, but then don’t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thide and bury your correction, and do all the stupid tricks that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpeople in media have done. Just say, “We screwed up.

It’s\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treally easy to consume, and it’s really efficient. If you want to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tread more, you don’t have to go to another page. It just drops down\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeautifully in your screen. You’re not going to have a pop-up ad. It\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tis, I think, the nicest possible user architecture created for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmedia. It’s awesome. I had nothing to do with it. This woman, Alexis\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLloyd, who is at the New York Times. She’s working at the New York\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTimes lab, and she was studying the future of news, looking at data.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tShe came to the exact same conclusion that we did, coming in from a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttotally different angle. She said, “Oh, my gosh, this is exactly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhat people want.” By the time we met her, she could finish our\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsentences, and then, she could do something I couldn’t do, which is\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdesign something. Then Matt Baume, who was also at the New York\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTimes lab building that stuff, came on because he wanted to build\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit, exactly the way that we were articulating it, and the way that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAlexis was designing it. That’s where, if you get the opportunity to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe part of a startup, there is nothing more fun in the professional\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tside of your life. It is a blast, to have an idea, and to see an\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tidea take off with a group of people who come at it with really\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdifferent talent sets, really different backgrounds, that clash of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tideas, the clash of personalities, the clash of egos, and then\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvoila. An idea comes from that, that works, that people read or\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpeople trust, they’re just the coolest possible thing. Not everyone\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twill be able to do it, but you should all look at yourselves as\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tentrepreneurs, even if you’re going to go through a more\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconventional route through work, in that it’s not going to be my\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tparents’ generation, where you’re somewhere for 40 years. You’re\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgoing to constantly be moving. You have to constantly think about\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe skill sets that you need.

I believe\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat…I’m a big believer. For-profit companies, and they create a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttype of culture and a type of company that’s going to be a lot more\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdynamic. I love that people put money into not-for-profits. I don’t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthink that’s the best solution for journalism. I think for-profit\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcompanies are the best. There’s only a couple ways to make money in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tjournalism. You can sell subscriptions, you can sell ads, you can do\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tevents. They’re basically the three ways of making money in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tjournalism. For me, as long as you’re marking something as sponsored\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontent or as an ad, I’m all for it. I’m very pro-it. What we did\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tis, we said, “Okay, let’s sit down.” If you’re going to design an ad\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat provides the least amount of intrusion and distraction for the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treader but forces the reader to interact with it in a way that the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadvertiser gets value. Too many media companies, “Oh, advertisers.”\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIt’s your money. If you don’t have advertising, you don’t have\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmoney. You don’t have money, you don’t have a job. You don’t have,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthen there’s no company. You want to make that experience beautiful\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor the reader, beautiful for the advertiser. All we did is, we\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlooked at, what is the best experience out there for the advertiser,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor the reader? It’s with Facebook, setting up the nice stream,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhere you go through because it’s there. You can choose whether or\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot to stop. You’re working with a small space, so if you’re clever\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabout your graphics, your video, your headlines, you can actually\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tget awesome interaction with it. Our ads have a 2-4x engagement\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\timprovement from any other ad for that very reason, because we put a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlot of time, thinking, into the making those as beautiful as the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontent themselves. As long as they’re labeled, that’s all you can\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdo. That’s all you should do, and you need them. If you take them\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taway, you’ve got nothing, because one of the dumbest things the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmedia industry did, maybe one of the dumbest things any industry has\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdone in the history of all industries, was that our industry, when\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Internet came along, we said, “Hey, you know what? Let’s all\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tband together. Let’s take a product that’s extremely expensive to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproduce, really valuable,” something the consumer really likes a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlot, “You know what we should do? Let’s give it away for free.”\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWouldn’t that be an awesome idea? That’s what we did for ten years.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWe habituated an entire generation of consumers to take something\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor free that costs a lot of money. You don’t get your music for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfree. You don’t get your movies for free. You don’t get your food\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor free. We were giving away a product for free. That needs to be\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcorrected, and one way is through subscriptions. You’ve been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thabituated to not pay for content. Other than the New York Times,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, FT. I would say the Wall\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tStreet Journal and the FT are business expenses, so I put that on a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdifferent category. The New York Times and only recently the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWashington Post, there’s very few examples of content companies that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpeople are willing to pay enough money for to support a viable media\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcompany. That is what it is. I’m talking about the written news\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspace. Maybe that changes with time. I don’t know. We’ll see if it\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdoes. That’s an open question. That’s a long way of saying, I love\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tour ads.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>[Laughter]</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Michael Chien:</strong> Unfortunately for me, but good for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe rest of you, this is my last question. Among all the things\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twe’ve talked about, from the Internet, to advertising, to quality\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontent, fake news, a lot of people would say that money is the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbiggest factor when it comes to journalism management. You’ve said\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the past that, at POLITICO, you guys reached what you called a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnirvana, where 50% of your revenue came from ads, the other 50% was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsubscriptions. Why is it not 100 to 0? Is that because it’s not\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfeasible, or is it because the ads genuinely provide, I guess, value\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor the stakeholders and for the readers, in consuming that content?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Jim VandeHei</strong>: The reason is that, number one, at\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPOLITICO, the subscription side is not like the New York Times. At\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPOLITICO we created what we call POLITICO Pro, which is a high-end\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsubscription service for people who are doing politics and policy\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprofessionally. The starting price is $8,000. It’s not like you’re\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbuying that or we’re buying that. You would have to be doing it as a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbusiness. It turned out to be an awesome business, but if that’s all\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twe did, all we would’ve been doing is writing content for a very\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsmall sliver of people that saw great value in it, but you’re not\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treally doing the public service dimension of it. If I just wanted to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbuild a business just to make money, that’s what I would do. It’s\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe easiest way to make money in journalism right now, high-end\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinformation, charge a lot of money, boom. I don’t like that. I like\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit as a business, but I don’t like it alone. I like it if it helps\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsupport public journalism. POLITICO, a couple weeks ago, it was one\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the finest moments since I left POLITICO, to watch, we had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcreated healthcare verticals, our first one cost you about ten grand\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor a company or association to get it. Our theory was, if we could\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tget six or eight people covering healthcare, and you’re doing it\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith people who’ve been doing it at the most granular level, a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcouple times a year, they’re going to come across awesome journalism\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof political consequence, or there’s going to be a difficult,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcomplex debate, but you’re going to have all this brainpower behind\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit, and you take that content, and you put it public. The group of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpeople that exposed the HHS secretary and forced him out, because he\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas doing illegal travel, was from that POLITICO Pro team. The\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheory of the case worked, but you need, I think you need, both. The\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpublic dimension of journalism is why I’m a journalist. The fact\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat you can make a difference, you can inform tons of people, that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou can help shape how people are seeing really important ideas.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThat part of it, at least based on the economics and the habits\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttoday, has to be supported by advertising. There’s not another way\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taround it. I run into people that, especially out here a lot, who\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdon’t like advertising. I’m begging you, like advertising.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>[Laughter]</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Jim VandeHei</strong>: You’ve got to, otherwise there’s no\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tway to support the type of content that you’re reading.

Then, also, given that there’s a lot of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tanti-establishment values against our generation, what would you say\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto those young people like the millennials and slightly older who\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlook at Axios and see some of the business partners, such as banks,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpharma, industries that are skeptical, that Axios is the best forum\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto really give trustworthy anti-establishment information?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Jim VandeHei</strong>: All I can say is, the beauty of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontent is there. You can read it. You’re either going to trust it\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tor not. You might not like the Koch brothers. You might not like a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbank. You might not like the Wildlife Federation, whoever it is\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat’s advertising on any given day. If that scares you off, I can’t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchange it. The advertisers advertise, and I am not discriminating\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst advertisers, as long as you’re not saying something that’s\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmean-spirited, like totally wrong, or violent, or whatever. We have\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tour parameters on that. What I would say, look at the content. Look\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat the quality of the content. Is this something that you find\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tedifying? Is it something that you trust? Is it something that’s\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmaking you smarter faster? If it’s not, don’t read it. If it is,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tread a lot more of it, and then tell your friends about it,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAxios.com.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>[Laughter]</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Jim VandeHei</strong>: I wrote a piece for the Wall Street\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tJournal during my period between leaving POLITICO, my cooling-off\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tperiod before I started Axios. The point of the piece was that the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsystem needs a shock. In some ways, you need something different\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthan we have, and throughout different ideas, like Zuckerberg,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhoever, but somebody who’s thinking about it differently, in that,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand I actually believe this even more powerfully today than I did\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthen. The system, put aside Trump. The system in some ways is so\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdetached from the reality that we’re about to have. We have two\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpolitical parties that spend their time arguing about things that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmade a lot of sense 15 years ago, made some sense 10 years ago,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstill make a little bit of sense, but they’re not actually the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttopics that are going to define whether or not China eats our lunch\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the next 20 years. We’ve got, we want. You’ve got to be able to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmodernize government. Cybersecurity, I guarantee the catastrophe we\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thave will flow from some cyber attack that none of us are thinking\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabout right now. If you don’t have the right technologists and the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tright technology, redoing government, we’re hugely vulnerable. Then\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou take that overseas. We grew up in a time of conventional wars.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWe’re going to take boots on the ground. We’re going to go to war\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith another country. That’s never going to happen again. All of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthese things are going to be fought in space, and they’re going to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe fought with drones. Any given day, this very day, this would have\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen true under Obama too, we’re executing people via drone in four\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdifferent countries. Have been for the last six-seven years. Will be\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprobably forever. Our enemies aren’t necessarily just going to be\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnation states. They’re going to be things like Al Qaeda\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmetastasizing into ISIS, which will metastasize into something else\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich requires a government that basically fought wars the same way\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor a long time to rethink about the War Powers Act. How do you move\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfast enough to be able to adapt to these different threats? Then,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou look domestically. What is the fundamental challenge? You can\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbemoan globalization all you want, and there’s pros and cons to it,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut the technology is only going to bring people and countries\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcloser together, markets closer together. That is the arc of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thistory. I don’t believe you can bend it any other way. Then, you\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thave to look at the country. You say, “What is it that we need to do\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto make sure that, this is the best damn country ten years from\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnow?” One, you’d better make sure that this is the place that people\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twant to come and start businesses. It still is. People love this\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcountry. They might be down on it because of Trump or different\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdynamics that we have, but people love America. They still think\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit’s the best place to start companies, the best place to birth new\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tideas. If you don’t get that right over time, if you don’t get, are\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twe getting people who come here? Are we getting immigrants who want\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto come here, start companies? They come here, start companies, and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstay here. Are you then creating a tax code that makes sense in a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tglobalized system, where you have mass amounts of competitors that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmight have a competitive disadvantage or competitive advantage\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\toverseas? You need to be able to rewire the country on the domestic\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tside and on the foreign side to make sure that we continue to crush\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit. We are, for all the hangdog crap I hear about, “Oh, my God!\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAmerica’s going to Hell!” It’s not going to Hell. I’ve spent, we’ve\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbuilt a company in Europe before we left POLITICO. I’d much, much,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmuch rather be an American than be sitting in Europe. They’re in a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlot of trouble. Their governing system doesn’t work. Their borders\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tare really poor. They’re dealing with terrorists threats and the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teffects of that, and migration in ways that are much more powerful\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthan some of the debates that we’re having here. “Oh, China, China,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tChina!” Come on. Yes, they could steal our ideas, which they do.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThey can bully companies into doing things in their country. They\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcan do that. They have lots of people, but it’s a crappy governing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsystem that doesn’t have as dynamic of a culture, and is not, I\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdon’t believe, going to be a long-term threat, as big a long-term\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthreat as people fear, if we get those things right. Otherwise, if\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twe don’t, it will, or India will, or Vietnam will, or whoever else\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twill. That’s a long way of answering the journal piece about just\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsaying, I do think that there probably needs to be a new set of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tideas that people are talking about, and it actually might happen\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsoon, because if somebody’s, look at what’s happening with the two\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tparties. In some ways, we probably should have four political\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tparties right now, because the difference between the Trump wing of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe party and the Ryan wing of the party, they’re almost two\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdifferent parties. They have really pulled themselves apart. The\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdifference between the Clinton wing and the Sanders wing is pretty\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprofound. I think really profound, and that Sanders wing is only\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgetting pulled further to the left. In some ways, if you have four\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdifferent parties right now on a lot of these topics, you might have\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Sanders wing and the Trump wing often teaming up, especially\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhen it comes to issues like trade, US jobs, and so I don’t know how\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis plays out. All I know is that every single job, every single\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsector, is getting disrupted and will continue to get disrupted. I\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdon’t think politics is any different. Is technology or\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttechnologists, the Zuckerbergs of the world, the solution? I don’t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tknow. I think that those companies have a bigger political priority.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI don’t think Mark Zuckerberg hired David Plouffe and other people\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause he’s thinking he’s going to run for president. I think he’s\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsmartly realized he has a hell of a political problem on his hands,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat the more people learn about what’s happening on Facebook, the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmore they’re going to see their popularity fade, the more that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey’re going to see regulators regulate. It is the single biggest\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstory in this country this year, if you didn’t have Trump as\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpresident. It is basically, now, have this country starting to look\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat these big social platforms that we give all of our data, all of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tour time, all of our mindshare, and people are starting to think,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t“Whoa, wait a second. Did we give them too much?” Were they too\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunregulated? Is there too much mischief happening that we weren’t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taware of, and should there be a correction? I think there’ll be a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcorrection, and I think Europe in some ways is a template there,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause Europe has a much different view of data privacy, data\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprotection, and these big companies than we do. They regulate them\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmore. They tax them more. They fine them more, and that creates a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttemplate for what could happen, here. I’m not guaranteeing it does\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thappen here. We had, last week, we had Sheryl Sandberg. We’re the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tone company that interviewed her for a half hour. Mike Allen, on\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstage, grilled her pretty powerfully. They know they’re in for a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrilling on Capitol Hill about what was happening on that platform,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhat responsibility they have to be aware of it sooner than they\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tactually were, and what do they have to do now to make sure that,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat doesn’t happen again? That’s an amazing story. I think the best\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbook that’s going to be written is going to be the Mueller Report.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThink about it. Everyone’s like, “Oh, is he going to indict Trump?”\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI don’t know. I have my own theories on that, but what he is going\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto do is, he’s not just looking at Trump. He’s looking at the entire\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsystem. He is going to pull together a report that looks at a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforeign company, manipulating for the price of doughnuts, our\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\telection, on an unregulated platform, that may or may not have been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin cahoots with either a campaign, or elements around a campaign, to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tundoubtedly influence at least in some ways the election. We’ll\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnever know if it was decisive, but we’ll know that it was profound\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand potentially decisive, but we’ll never know decisive, that then\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thas spawned all kinds of crazy activity, including the firing of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tComey, which probably will go down in history as one of the dumbest\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthings that a president’s ever done, because it then gave him Robert\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMueller, who will write the report that I’m talking about.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>[Laughter]</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Jim VandeHei</strong>: It’s a fad.

I’m actually from Canada,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand in Canada our primary news source is Canadian Broadcasting\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCorporation. We use this and BBC, and at least from my personal\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texperience is that people often trust the state-owned media sources,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprimarily because they have less of an incentive to, as you\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmentioned earlier, resort to the lowest common denominator, be more\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tserious about their news, because they have a relatively stable\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsource of funding. I just wanted to gauge your impact on the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstate-owned media resources and whether such a platform, whether\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsomething similar could work in the United States.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Jim VandeHei</strong>: We have PBS and NPR, which obviously\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tget some amount of public funding. I don’t think that’s the answer.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI don’t think, even if it were the answer, it’s never going to be\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe only thing, unless you had total state control, which then\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstomps out cataclysms. I would be opposed to that. Looking at it\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tclinically, it’s an interesting question, just not going to happen,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tso I don’t spend a whole lot of time entertaining the possibility. I\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdo agree with you, I don’t know, I’m familiar with the Canadian but\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagain, I’m not going to lie to you.

It can come even when I’m dogging on not-for-profits.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI’m dogging on the culture that a not-for-profit can create, not the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\toutput. I love that we have lots of not-for-profits that are doing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestigative reporting, which is the hardest type of reporting to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tactually create a business model around, but to me, you’re going to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\talways end up with a mix of all those things, and so if it works in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCanada, it’s great that it works in Canada. I will say, if you go to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBritain, the SUF, the BBC, but I don’t know if that’s often the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdominant voice. London is now a hotbed, for almost every single\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmedia company’s now creating a London outpost, and you have\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBuzzfeed, and Business Insider, and you have the tabloids there.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLondon, other than New York, is probably one of the hottest places\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor that, with a really vibrant media market that gets you from a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbunch of different angles. I think, again, I’m a big fan of more.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI’m also a big fan of you understanding what it is you’re reading,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand whether or not you can trust it or should trust it, and if\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsomething is fake or something is nonsense, that there’s a way for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou to be able to easily pick up that, that’s fake or that’s\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnonsense.

It\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvolves your decision to start Axios, and I know obviously it’s not\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsomething like making podcasts, that’s a shift in media consumption\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat’s [changing] just the way that we’re consuming media. As\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprogressives, do you think [there will continue to be a] go-to for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tliberal media? What do you see, the trends? How do you see media\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t[changing over the next few years]?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Jim VandeHei</strong>: It’s hard for me to tell what it\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlooks like beyond the next couple of years. I think over the next\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcouple of years, I think media consumption is going to become more\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand more awesome, in that as you get from 4G to 5G to 6G, as you get\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnetworks are quick enough, I think what you’re going to have is…\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNewsletters are interesting. Newsletters, in terms of really\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tespecially hyper-engaged readers, they’re awesome. Our newsletters\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdo extraordinarily well, and people love it. Why? Because it’s\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tefficient, it’s pushed to you, it’s shorter and smarter. It often\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thas more voice. I think what we’ll see, and I think you’ll hopefully\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsee it from us, is to me ideally newsletters, podcasts, all of that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstuff blends itself into an app stream, meaning that you have a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twatch/listen/read experience that’s tailored to what you might want\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tor the way you want to consume information utilizing all these\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttechnologies which are a lot cheaper to do today than they would’ve\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen three or four years ago. That will be a great, great, great\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsumption experience and is a great production experience. The\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\topportunity [is splendid]. How many people here are in journalism or\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tare going to go into the media? I don’t know who you have in here. I\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthink sometimes people come in, and they’re like, “Oh, my God! Media\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsucks! It’s dying.” It’s not. It’s way better to be you than it is\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto be me, in terms of, because you’re coming of age, and you’re\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcoming into it with this skill set that totally matches the moment.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe moment needs, there’s going to be the boom over the next couple\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyears and the need for video content’s going to be insane. Look at\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe money that not just ESPN, we have this… If you’re in media,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou’ve got to go to axios.com, and subscribe to our media trends\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnewsletter. She is the smartest person I’ve ever met thinking about\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmedia. She had this thing the other day about how Netflix now is\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\talmost tied with ESPN in terms of paying for content. Imagine if you\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad Snapchat, not paying for it, but now Snapchat will pay for it,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut better rev shares now. Facebook’s starting to pay for a lot more\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontent. All of these new distribution channels that are going to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treplace cable, and nobody knows what will replace it, but everyone\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tknows something will replace it. The demand for video content,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdemand for audio content, the demand for I would still say\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttext-based content, it’s only getting better. You’re growing up with\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat skill set, and you’re growing up with those consumption habits,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tso you’re actually much better positioned to help solve the future\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthan somebody who’s my age or older, and grew up in a static, “I\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tjust read a newspaper this way,” experience. You should not go into\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe profession being bummed. You should go into it being very, very,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvery optimistic. People are, like I said, if they’re consuming 12\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thours of media content of some form each and every day, just get in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe fight for their mindshare. That’s what it is, now. It’s now a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbattle of mindshare, that’s why you have all of these companies\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttrying to diversify. Facebook, at point you hit all the people\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou’re going to hit, and you then win all of that battle to get more\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand more mindshare over the course of the day. That’s going to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbenefit the content producers, the content distributors, the content\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teditors, and so it’s a great time to go and be a part of that. The\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpodcasts will be part of it. Podcasts, often we chase mirages in our\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tindustry. We’re like, “Oh, traffic.” Then you wake up, “Actually,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit’s not that great.” Then, it was video five years ago. Great, you\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproduce a lot of video. It turns out you still couldn’t monetize it.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPodcasts were hot. I always said, “Show me.” Yes, that’s great.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tYou’ve got X-number of viewers or X-number of listeners. How much\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmoney you making off that? How much money did it cost you to produce\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit? If the cost of production is greater than the money you’re\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmaking off it, it’s not actually a profitable business. It might be\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta good investment long term. It’s essentially not a good business.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPodcasts are still, for the most part, still there. They get a good\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taudience, but there’s not a ton of money attached to it. Doesn’t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmean that there won’t be. I think it’ll come from all of that stuff\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstarting to live together and some of the stuff sorting itself out\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin terms of, we have so many content producers now, and so many\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdistribution networks. Eventually, stuff will narrow itself down.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPodcasts will definitely [still be around].\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t</Container>\r\n\t\t\t<Footer />\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t);\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default RandPaul;\r\n","import React from 'react';\r\n\r\nimport '../../css/Blog.scss';\r\nimport Header from '../A-WebElements/Header';\r\nimport Footer from '../A-WebElements/Footer';\r\n\r\nimport Container from 'react-bootstrap/Container';\r\nimport Row from 'react-bootstrap/Row';\r\n\r\nconst RandPaul = () => {\r\n\treturn (\r\n\t\t<div className=\"conversations\">\r\n\t\t\t<Header name=\"blog\" />\r\n\t\t\t<Container fluid className=\"blog-content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<div className=\"header-press\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFormer White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest at the Berkeley\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tForum\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p className=\"italics\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMr. Earnest appeared at the Berkeley Forum on October 12, 2017.

You described media interaction today as\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeing more of a food fight than a discussion. Given your role as\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpress secretary, how did this understanding of the press guide how\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou issued press statements or answered questions in briefings?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Josh Earnest:</strong> That’s an excellent question. What\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI’m sure of is I’m sure I’m not the first White House spokesperson\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto complain about this, and I’m sure that George Washington’s press\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsecretary had the same [complaint]. But what is just undeniable is\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthere were countless times where I would walk out to the briefing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\troom, prepared to roll out a new policy and to discuss a new\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tannouncement or a new idea that we were ready to put forward, and I\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould get more questions about the criticism of that policy that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcame from either left or the right than about the policy itself. I\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thaven’t been there in nine months and I’m still frustrated by it.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBut that the essence of our system, and if you think about it, this\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tis the vulnerability in our political ecosystem that Trump has\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpertly capitalized on, exploited. This is why he uses Twitter and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsays outrageous things on Twitter. It distracts from a bunch of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tother things that we should be talking about, and it degrades our\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpolitical debate.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSo, the way that I tried to take this on was to remember that it was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmy responsibility, as an advocate for the president and as an\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadvocate for the president’s policies, that when I walked into the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbriefing room, my responsibility was not to charge through the door\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand prove that all the reporters’ skeptical questions were wrong.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAnd the reason that that is an unwise strategy is it’s the reporters\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthemselves who are going to characterize the debate for their\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treaders and their viewers, and there is never going to be a day that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey begin their story by writing or saying, “Today, the White House\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPress Secretary proved us all wrong!” So, in the midst of an\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenvironment where people are focused on fighting, at least one way\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto combat that is to martial evidence, to present facts, to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsubstantiate your case, and that’s what I tried to do when I\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprepared for the briefing every day, was to help the journalists who\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere in that room understand what our argument was, understand the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbasis for that argument, and to be able to write some evidence about\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhy our argument just might be right.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThat strategy proved to work well, but not perfectly. I think there\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tare a variety of things that make the White House briefing different\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnow than it was before, and one of them is that when you listen to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe people who stand behind that podium now, they’re often not in a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tposition where they are making an argument. If you listen, you often\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thear lots of assertions, some of which have some basis in reality\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand some which don’t, you hear a lot of promises, some of which are\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twithin the realm of the possible and many of which are not, and it\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tundermines their ability to be particularly persuasive. And I think\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat shows up in the coverage of the briefing, and I think it shows\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tup in the coverage of the White House.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Shaina Zuber:</strong> As you mentioned, the relationship\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbetween the current administration and the press has been fairly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tantagonistic, with President Trump using terms such as “fake news”\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto describe major media outlets. Given this, what do you think is\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe ideal relationship between the press and the administration? Do\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou think it should be more access-based, more adversarial? What do\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou think creates the most ideal situation for a democracy?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Josh Earnest:</strong> The relationship between the White\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHouse press corps and the White House is supposed to be adversarial,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand the day that it’s not is the day that the press corps stop doing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir jobs. I made that observation frequently when people would,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabout every month or so, want to assess the state of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trelationship between the Obama White House and White House press\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcorps at the time. There were some times when it would be good, some\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttimes when they would be pretty frustrated that there hadn’t been a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnews conference in a while, for example, and it was my job, standing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat the nexus of that relationship, to try to defuse that tension, or\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat least keep that tension from preventing either side from doing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir job effectively. If the press corps was so amped up, and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tangry, and frustrated about the fact that we hadn’t had a news\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconference in six weeks, that’s going to color their coverage, so we\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tneed to try to find a way to resolve that. If the president and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmembers of his senior staff are so exasperated by the kind of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcoverage that they’re getting from the press corps, there are some\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho may have the instinct that, well, we should stop dealing with\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem, we should stop engaging with them, or stop returning that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tperson’s phone calls. That’s not an effective way for managing that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trelationship because if you don’t return that reporter’s phone call,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI guarantee that he or she is continuing to write good stories, and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey’re not going to make it better if you ignore them.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<br></br>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<br></br>So, I view that as an important part of my responsibility,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tis to try to manage that relationship. So, my job was not to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teliminate tension or to prevent disagreements from arising. My\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tresponsibility was to try to manage and mitigate those disagreements\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand that tension so that it stayed at a sustainable level that would\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tallow both sides to continue to do their job, and I think ultimately\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat is the kind of relationship that best serves the president and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe White House. It’s a relationship that well serves the American\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpublic in terms of ensuring that there are independent, professional\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tjournalists on the job every day holding the White House\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccountable, holding people in power accountable.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSo, it doesn’t sound like a particularly ideal situation, but\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdemocracy is a little messy. It’s supposed to be when it’s working.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThat’s evidence that it’s working. I remember that there was one\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tparticularly well-respected political journalist in Washington who\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas frustrated for a reason that even to this day I don’t quite\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tknow, but who described the lack of transparency on the part of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhite House as “dangerous.” Dangerous! I think we now know what the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlack of transparency that’s dangerous looks like. It looks a lot\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdifferent than the relations that we had.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Shaina Zuber:</strong> Some of these issues of dealing with\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe press relationship included controversies surrounding the Obama\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAdministration’s decision to prosecute whistleblowers under the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEspionage Act, or decisions to not allow FOIA requests. How do you\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthink this impacted your job as press secretary and the relationship\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith the press?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Josh Earnest:</strong> Look, we had lots of debates about\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttransparency, and this was a common point of tension in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trelationship between the White House and the White House press\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcorps. But again, if there’s ever a day where the reporters are\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsitting at the back of the room saying, “Boy, you guys have\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tresponded to more than 90% of the FOIA requests that we’ve\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsubmitted. Thank you so much for your service. We’re really\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsatisfied with that.” They should be out there saying, “Well,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhere’s the other 10%?” That is their job. They should never be\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsatisfied. So, I was comfortable with the critique and the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinsistence on the part of journalists that there should be more\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttransparency. I think what I was not comfortable with were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpressions like “a dangerous lack of transparency,” or exaggerated\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuggestions that somehow the White House was more hostile to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treporters than even the Nixon Administration, something that is not\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttrue, but something that a number of journalists said.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTo illustrate for you how much of a point of tension this was, I\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tactually wrote a letter to the editor of The New York Times about\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis, and the argument that I made in that letter was simply that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis is supposed to be a point of tension between the White House\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand the press corps, but when there are things that we get right,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthere should be an acknowledgement that we got them right. There has\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto be some kind of built-in positive reinforcement mechanism if\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou’re advocating for something, and there’s nobody in the world\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat has the time to be a consistent, well-informed, persistent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadvocate for transparency other than the White House press corps,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand you’re not going to be an effective advocate if the people that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou are holding accountable aren’t occasionally given credit for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgetting it right. It doesn’t mean you should say you’re satisfied,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut just the acknowledgement where progress is made is important to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teffective advocacy.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIf you think about this in a different setting: If you work for the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNRA, you don’t just spend all your time beating up on the Democrats\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho don’t toe the line. You also want to look for ways to give\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcredit for those who are on your side. That makes them an\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\textraordinarily effective advocacy organization in Washington, and I\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthink it is one way in which the White House press corps’ advocacy\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton this issue fell short and made them, in some cases, not as\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teffective as they could.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Shaina Zuber:</strong> Do you think this has any spillover\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teffects into the press’ current relationship with the current\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadministration?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Josh Earnest:</strong> No, to be blunt. I do think that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthere might have been a situation where you could’ve made an\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\targument that, again, in an alternate universe where Hillary Clinton\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas president, that you had—to be blunt about it—people in positions\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof authority who were making more rational decisions about how to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tact with the press corps, where you could basically point to the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texperience of the Obama Administration, where we got criticized even\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin those situations where we made progress. And then when that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprogress was rolled back under a Clinton White House,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thypothetically, you could say, “Well, what argument can you make to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Clinton people that they should keep doing it when you didn’t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgive the Obama people credit for doing it?” But I don’t think that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Trump people are making their decisions based on the way that we\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdid things, and in some cases the things that serve as a kind of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttension with the press corps I think are often decisions that were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmade without any consideration whatsoever of the press corps’\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinterests.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Shaina Zuber:</strong> Along these lines, in an interview on\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCNN, you stated that in the position of press secretary, you and the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trecently resigned Sean Spicer had maintained a very different set of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tresponsibilities. How do you think the administration or the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpresident impacts the role of press secretary and how they interact\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith the press?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Josh Earnest:</strong> That’s a great question. The\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tresponsibility of the press secretary is set by the president.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tYou’re the spokesperson for the President of the United States, and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou have a responsibility to perform according to the instructions\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand wishes of the president. Now, there are competing interests. You\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\talso have a responsibility to tell the truth. So, some White House\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspokespeople have encountered a conflict in those two competing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpriorities, but those were never competing priorities [for me].\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThere was never a day where the president came into my office and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsaid, “You know what, Josh, I want you to be really careful today. I\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twant you to be sure to tell the truth.” He never had to say that. He\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdidn’t have to say it the other way, too. He also never had to come\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinto my office and say, “Now, be sure you don’t lie.” That was a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcore requirement, and that is something that starts at the top. When\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou are leading an organization, you have just as much influence\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover that organization based on what you do as by what you say. And\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thow President Obama conducted himself, by holding himself to a very\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thigh standard, was a practice that other senior administration\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tofficials tried to emulate, and certainly one of the reasons that we\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdidn’t have the same kind of scandals in the Obama Administration\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat other administrations have had, not just the current\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadministration. And while certainly staff members deserve credit for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat, it starts at the top, and that’s true when you’re talking\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabout positive things, like avoiding scandals, but it’s true when\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou’re talking negative things too.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Shaina Zuber:</strong> Thank you so much for answering my\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquestions.

What role do you think\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttech companies and social media companies play as a form of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmedium that journalists use to spread their message?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Josh Earnest:</strong> This is a great question and one that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tis being debated in Washington, D.C., one that’s being debated in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnewsrooms all around the world—and certainly as a subject of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconcern—by people who get their news in a very different way than\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey used to even five or eight years ago. The example that I’ve\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\toften cited is: In the last couple of years of the Obama\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAdministration, we really prioritized our effort to be more creative\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand to integrate social media tools into our efforts to inform the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpublic about what we were doing. So, that meant that we would make\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnews, make announcements, offer up new ideas in ways other than just\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tissuing a White House news release that we emailed to our White\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHouse press list. Sometimes we would send tweets. Sometimes we would\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpost a video or a message to the President’s Facebook page or to the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhite House Facebook page.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThere were times early in that transition where very sophisticated\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhite House journalists would come to my office and they would knock\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton the door and say, “Josh, can I come in?” I’d say, “Sure, come on\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin.” And they would say, “Listen, I saw that you sent that tweet\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom President Obama about that announcement.” I said, “Yeah, we\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdid, we did. It got retweeted tens of thousands of times.” They\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsaid, “If you do that again, will you send me an email to give me a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\theads up that you’ve done that?” And I said, “Well, I’ll try, but I\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcan’t promise I’m going to do that.” But what that illustrates is\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teven the people who are highly-trained professionals who work long\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thours and have dedicated their career to closely following what’s\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thappening at the White House have a hard time keeping up in this\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnews environment. It moves so quickly that even they have a hard\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttime keeping track of all that’s happening, so why are we\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tparticularly surprised that the American public is having a hard\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttime keeping up, that they are in a situation where they have a hard\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttime deciphering between hard news stories and fake news?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSo, we do need to think hard in the midst of the dynamic news\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenvironment about what we can do to bolster confidence in the news\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmedia, and more effectively and consistently give people reliable\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinformation about our political system. I certainly do think that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttechnology does have the potential of addressing many elements of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis problem, but another thing that we can do is make sure that, in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tour schools all across America, that we are training sophisticated\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsumers of information. We know that we live in an age where\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinformation is an important element of our economy, so there’s a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgood reason to do that. We’re not just educating good citizens, but\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpeople who can succeed in our economy if we teach them how to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tevaluate, consume, and make decisions about information, and the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmore that we can put good thinkers in our education system or\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproduce good thinkers in our education system, the better off our\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomy is just going to be.

I was shocked by the outcome\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand so many of my colleagues in the White House were as well. I\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremember sitting on the sofa in my living room, watching the returns\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcome in. I was sitting there with my wife and she, every 20 minutes\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tor so, would look at me and she’d say, “You nervous yet?” And I’d\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsay, “Nah, it’s going to be fine. The votes are still coming in.” I\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlive in the state of Virginia. We voted in the state of Virginia.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tVirginia was one of those places where Trump started out with a big\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlead that was very disconcerting to a lot of people, but over the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcourse of the evening Hillary made up ground and steadily eroded his\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmargin, and actually ended up winning the state. And I\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpected/hoped that we would see a similar phenomenon in Michigan,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand Ohio, and Pennsylvania, and Florida, and when it became clear\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat we were going to need to see that situation replicated in all\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof those states at the same time, then I knew it was time to worry.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBut look, what was remarkable about that week was the day after the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\telection. I stayed up late the night of the election, knowing that I\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas going to have to do the daily briefing the next day and answer a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlot of tough, pressing questions about the rhetoric that President\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tObama had used on the campaign trail. He had said that he did not\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thave confidence that the country would be safe with the nuclear\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcodes in the hands of Donald Trump. He said that he’d pose a threat\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto our democracy. He said that Trump was likely to be in a position\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto succeed in rolling back a whole bunch of the progress that we’d\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmade with the Obama Administration. He’d painted a pretty bleak\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpicture about what could possibly happen if Trump was elected\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpresident – and then Trump was elected president. I also anticipated\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgetting questions about how we could be so wrong given that Trump’s\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tentire political identity was rooted in opposing Obama. I\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tanticipated a lot of questions about whether or not this was a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpretty stark rebuke from the American public to the Obama White\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHouse about what we had done.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSo, it was a hard day and one that was physically demanding and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\temotionally demanding, but I took a lot of inspiration from the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpresident speaking in the Rose Garden that afternoon after Secretary\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tClinton had conceded. President Obama went out to the Rose Garden\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand said that history doesn’t move in a straight line, progress\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdoesn’t move in a straight line, and there’s zigs and zags, and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\toccasionally we move back before we move forward, and that’s why\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit’s important to take the long view and to keep a long-term\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tperspective in regard to the trajectory of our country. He expressed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\this commitment to ensuring a smooth transition to the incoming\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadministration. It reminded me of the notion that in countering and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tovercoming adversity, it doesn’t build character necessarily, but it\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcertainly reveals it, and I thought President Obama revealed a lot\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof character in that moment, and I tried to live up to the standard\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat he set when I moved to the Briefing Room later that day.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe other thing that has been reported about that day is that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPresident Obama went around the White House to talk to his White\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHouse staff and to buck them up, to encourage them, to console them.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHe showed incredible leadership that day, on a day that must have\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen very difficult for him, and he did most of that work in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprivate. It revealed, to me, yet again, the high-quality character\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat he is.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Audience Member:</strong> My question is: The reputation of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tD.C. is [that] everyone inside the Beltway knows everybody, hangs\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tout with everybody. I’m curious what your relationship with the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpress is like on a personal level. Do you have friends or drinking\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbuddies? Were friendships gained or destroyed before, during, and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tafter your time in the White House?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Josh Earnest:</strong> Good question. What I will tell you\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tis that I, like many people in Washington, have friendly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trelationships with reporters. It’s particularly interesting now\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause I’m employed by a news organization; I’m a contributor to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNBC News. But the thing that I constantly remembered when I was at\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe White House is that it is entirely appropriate—even my\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tresponsibility—to be friendly with reporters, but let’s also\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremember that reporters are not your friends.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWe were staying about an hour away from the summit site because of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsecurity restrictions, because all the world leaders were attending\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe summit. So, we stayed at a hotel in Bali that had a very nice\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tswimming pool that overlooked the ocean, and as was customary,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPresident Obama left the summit before the press corps because the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpress corps would often want to stay—the TV reports in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tparticular—and do a news report on location in Bali, summarizing the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPresident’s trip. So, the timing worked out that we stayed for six\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tor eight or ten hours after President Obama had left Bali, and we\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere staying at this hotel because of the time difference. It was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tduring the day in Bali. President Obama was somewhere over the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPacific Ocean on a plane. Nobody had any practical, functional\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tresponsibilities, so it meant that you had White House press staff\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand all these reporters swimming in the swimming pool overlooking\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Indian Ocean in Bali. So, yeah, there were times where I get my\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshirt off and I’m in the swimming pool hanging out with these\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tjournalists who were in their clothes too. When in Bali!\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBut the thing that I can tell you is those close quarters we were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tworking in meant that, yeah, you developed a friendly relationship\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith the reporters, but you get back on that plane and you get back\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto the United States of America, and you’re on opposite sides again.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAnd that adversarial relationship, even if it was sort of suspended\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin unique moments like that, I’m not at all under the impression\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat anybody ever went easy on me because we had a couple of hours\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the sun in Bali. Good question.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Audience Member:</strong> I was just wondering, with a White\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHouse Secretary who has to find that balance, like you said, between\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttruth and sometimes what the press is trying to convey, what is your\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadvice to [Sarah Huckabee Sanders]?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Josh Earnest:</strong> Tell the truth. That really is it.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLook, there are situations where it can be really hard to take on a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquestion that basically everybody knows the answer to, and there is\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta way to present a case that can shape the answer to the question\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat doesn’t require you to mobilize false information. So, let me\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgive you a good example of that.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn 2014, President Obama was, in many ways, at the nadir of his\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpolitical influence, and this is not uncommon for presidents after\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsix years that their influence starts to wane. Congress had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tparticularly dysfunctional. Republicans had majority in the House\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand they were using that to really flummox any effort that we were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmaking to move forward. Democrats were trying desperately to try to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thang on to their majority in the Senate, and of course they did not,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin part because President Obama was not particularly popular at that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpoint. And in the run up to that election, I got a lot of intense\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquestions about: Isn’t it true, Josh, that President Obama doesn’t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thave the kind of political influence that he used to have, even\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tamong Democrats, and the Democrats who are running for reelection\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdon’t want to be seen with the President of the United States and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey don’t want him to come campaign for them in their home states?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAnd of course that was true! Anybody who knows a thing about\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpolitics knew that was true, but I wasn’t going to walk out there\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand say, “Yeah, the President just doesn’t have much stroke and all\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthese Democrats are probably going to run from him.” What I did was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI went out there and said, “The truth is President Obama continues\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto have a lot of influence over Democrats, and President Obama has\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tput forward a message that a lot of people continue to support. And\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhile the public approval rating of President Obama’s performance as\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpresident is lower than it has been in the past, the approval of him\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas a person is still pretty much higher than any other person\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvolved in American politics right now.”\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSo, it is possible to make an argument to try to shape the answer to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe question that everybody already knows the answer to without\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstanding up and saying, “Of course that’s not true! We’ve turned\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdown all kinds of invitations to go campaign places,” which seems\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlike the kind of answer you might here in this environment. But, of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcourse, it was not true. That’s an excellent question.

If a reporter was going to go on and on\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand ask a 90-second-long question, it was going to be pretty easy to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tanswer, because they’re opening up all these avenues for responding\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto them. But when you ask a question as directly as you have, people\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tare going to be listening carefully to the answer to see if you’ve\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tanswered it. So, he’s got a bright future in journalism if he\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchooses to pursue it.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI’m pretty optimistic, and I think that it is possible for the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdemocracy that we have in this country right now to improve and to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tget better and to get stronger. And I think the healthiest\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdemocracies are the ones that are constantly evolving, constantly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treinventing themselves, either in response to outside forces or in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tresponse to the preferences of their citizens. Technology can shape\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit, the issues that we’re asking the government to confront can\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshape it, and whether that’s climate change or a conflict with\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tanother country, the best democracies are the ones that are going to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe responsive to those outside forces and responsive to the needs of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir citizens. And that’s not just going to shape the debate; it’s\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgoing to shape the essence of our government.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAnd I think part of the problem we have right now is that our\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdemocracy is pretty brittle, that we sort of keep bumping into the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsame kinds of constraints that have prevented us from doing things\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat are pretty obvious, things that are strongly supported by a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvast majority of the country. A strong majority of Americans support\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthings like comprehensive immigration reform, a smart investment in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tour infrastructure, common sense gun control. There are things that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twe can do, but our brittle democracy right now is preventing those\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthings from happening, and what we need is we need our democracy to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadapt and start electing people to office that aren’t just looking\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto pick a fight, but are actually looking to consider ideas where we\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcan find some common ground.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThis is a good way to end. It goes back to that argument that I was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmaking before. It’s easy to get attention for yourself if you can\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tengage in a fight and colorfully criticize and trash your opponent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tor somebody on the other side. It takes a little more work to try to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthink of a new idea or a creative solution, and then work with\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsomebody who may not totally agree with you to find some common\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tground on that idea. And the way that we’re going to get to see that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchange is if people who are in elected office feel pressure from us\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto choose that path, and I think that’s the sign of a healthy\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdemocracy, and I’m optimistic that at some point… I don’t know if\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit’s going to be the next election, in the midterms, or if it’s\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgoing to be the next presidential election, or where down the line,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut at some point we’re going to make that adaptation and we’re\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgoing to be better for it. It is authoritarian governments that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdon’t adapt very well. People who are in authoritarian positions of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpower are not used to responding to pressure and making changes, but\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat’s the essence of our democracy, and so I am optimistic that our\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcountry will continue to be a democracy. But if our democracy is\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgoing to be healthy and succeed, it’s going to continue to evolve.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGreat question.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t</Container>\r\n\t\t\t<Footer />\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t);\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default RandPaul;\r\n","import React from 'react';\r\n\r\nimport '../../css/Blog.scss';\r\nimport Header from '../A-WebElements/Header';\r\nimport Footer from '../A-WebElements/Footer';\r\n\r\nimport Container from 'react-bootstrap/Container';\r\nimport Row from 'react-bootstrap/Row';\r\n\r\nconst RandPaul = () => {\r\n\treturn (\r\n\t\t<div className=\"conversations\">\r\n\t\t\t<Header name=\"blog\" />\r\n\t\t\t<Container fluid className=\"blog-content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<div className=\"header-rand\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2>US Senator Rand Paul at the Berkeley Forum</h2>\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p className=\"italics\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUS Senator Rand Paul appeared at the Berkeley Forum on March 19,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2014. Senator Paul discussed the implications of NSA’s surveillance\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tactivities on liberty and his potential plans to run for the 2016\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRepublican nomination for President. The event was moderated by\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMatthew Freeman.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Matthew Freeman:</strong> Conservative activist, Larry\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tClayman, and the ACLU have also filed similar lawsuits against the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNSA. And both resulted in either failure or a stayed ruling. What\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmakes you think that you’ll have any more success than these groups\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat have tried before you?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Rand Paul: </strong>I am supportive of all the other\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlawsuits, so it isn’t exclusive that mine is the best, but it is\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tslightly different. The ACLU lawsuit was ruled against. The judge\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teither threw it out or said that the program was constitutional. The\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tClayman suit is in the same court that mine will go to. And the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tjudges previously ruled it unconstitutional, stayed the ruling, and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI think it will be appealed. So, I think the Clayman suit is still\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tactive. Ours is going to the same court because it has a similar\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsubject. Our case is slightly different, and we think, for some\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlegal reasons, that it may have a change of going all the way to the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSupreme Court.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTo me, it’s not so much that my case has to go, but I think a case\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tneeds to go to the Supreme Court. Because currently, many people\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbelieve that the Fourth Amendment doesn’t apply to all. They think\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat the reason why you can give a single warrant to Verizon is that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou don’t own those records. I think they’re jointly held. I think\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tif you sign a privacy agreement, Verizon agrees not to tell your\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tneighbor who you’re calling. So, they kind of acknowledge that. I\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthink it’s acknowledging that you still have an interest in those\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trecords.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBut to me, the most important thing is… And there’s at least, we\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthink, four or five Supreme Court justices that have indicated that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin this digital age, think about it, it’s a lot different than 1975.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThat’s when the last case, Smith versus Maryland, was held on\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trecords. It’s also different. That was about one suspect’s phone\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttap. We’re now talking about 300 million Americans’ phones. So, I\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthink it’s a big deal, and it is different than what we’ve ever had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbefore. So, I’m hoping that we will get all the way to the Supreme\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCourt.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong> Matthew Freeman:</strong> So, earlier, you condemned\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdirector of National Intelligence, James Clapper, for allegedly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlying in front of Congress. You said he’s very explicitly broken the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlaw. Does that mean that you think he should be sent to prison?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Rand Paul: </strong>I think he should be. You don’t get sent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto prison until you’re found guilty. So, we should have a trial. He\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeserves a trial. But the interesting thing is I’m not an outlier on\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis in the sense that I think seven members of the Intelligence\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCommittee or Judiciary Committee in the House have signed a letter\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsaying the same thing. And I think it hurts us because we do have to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trely on some things being secret. And it’s an extraordinary power.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIt’s a power to capture people, incarcerate people. It’s even a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpower to kill people. So, that power needs to be overseen, and they\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thave to be honest with us. If the people in charge of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIntelligence Committee are not being honest to Congress, and they’re\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tactually spying on Congress, I have grave doubts about everything\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey’re telling me.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSo, yeah, I think it is important. And one of the reasons I bring it\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tup is that many of these people, they want to throw the book at\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSnowden. And I have mixed feelings what should happen, because I\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthink you can’t release secrets all the time. That would lead to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchaos. But at the same time, I think he also wanted to reveal\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsomething he thought was unconstitutional. But for all the people\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat want to throw the book and the letter of the law at Snowden, I\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlike the contrast. They don’t want to do a thing…not a peep out of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem for Clapper. So, you’re not really being consistent if you want\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto throw the book at Snowden, but you don’t want to do a thing to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tClapper. They both broke the law technically. And then you have to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdecide what justice is. But yeah, I think Clapper should be tried\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor perjury.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Matthew Freeman:</strong> So, you say you’re asked this all\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe time, but we want to get in here, too. Would you classify Edward\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSnowden as on the one hand a hero or a traitor? And to phrase that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tslightly differently maybe, if there were another Edward Snowden out\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthere, would you encourage him to speak up?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Rand Paul: </strong> I think the ultimate decision of hero\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tor villain in history is going to sort out. And I think there are\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpros and cons to a lot of it. And I know people have a strong\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfeeling about it. I think that his intentions were good. But here’s\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe problem – let’s say we have 400, 500 people here, and let’s say\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou all are… We’re talking to you, and you’re the new recruits for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe CIA or for the intelligence for our army. Should I tell all 500\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof you, “Just decide when you think it’s unconstitutional and just\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treveal secrets any time.” You could see how it could lead to chaos.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBut at the same time, I’m very upset about what our intelligence\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommunity is doing, and we might not have ever known about it had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSnowden not leaked it. Some say Snowden should have tried to become\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta whistleblower.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI don’t know if he did try or what the process is. But I think on\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe one hand, you have chaos. Bradley Manning released 24 million\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpages. There’s a chance that people could die from that. There’s a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchance that intelligence could get out, and it could endanger our\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagents. And I’m not against spying. We will have people gathering\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tintelligence around the world. And I don’t think that we can allow\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twilly-nilly indiscriminate release of documents. But at the same\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttime, I’m sympathetic to what was released, because I think it’s a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treal problem. So, I have mixed feeling is the bottom line.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Matthew Freeman:</strong> So, you posed a very interesting\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquestion during your address. You asked about potential CIA spying\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton Senate computers. To quote you, “If the CIA is spying on\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCongress, who exactly can or will stop them?” So, what would be your\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tanswer to this question?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Rand Paul: </strong> Well, see, here’s the interesting\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthing. And this is worth everybody reading about. The way I\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunderstand it… And this is what Senator Feinstein said in her\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspeech. They came across something… They were given access to the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCIA computers by the CIA. The search engine was created by the CIA.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThey say… And I’m just going from what they’re telling me.
