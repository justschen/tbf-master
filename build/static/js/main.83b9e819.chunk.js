It was very much like people who were engineers, they were interested in building product or technologies and it was much geekier. In 2008, it changed quite a bit because Wall Street all of a sudden, became toxic or the toxicity was more public and people didn\u2019t want to go to Wall Street anymore. It was a time where the banks were starting to fail and people coming out of business school like Haas, decided I\u2019d rather go to tech where I can see that these guys from Google are now billionaires and they built their companies in 7 or 8 years and became billionaires with public offerings. Mark Zuckerberg was starting to come up and there was this idea that the way to make money is to go to Silicon Valley and no longer to go to Wall Street and that changed the culture. So, I think the culture got much more toxic after 2008. So, it\u2019s different than when I was there. If I look at venture, I think the big difference between venture and all of tech is that it\u2019s such a small group of people, it\u2019s such a concentration of power. There are the relationships, there are the people who can make companies and they\u2019re king makers. They pick a person and they invest in them and they put money into them and it doesn\u2019t matter what they do, they are able to get repeated chances. You look at the guy from Zenefits. He was fired for fraud and building software to get around insurance regulations and yet he started a new company and raised several million dollars from the same investors who had just barred him a year or so ago. So, you get multiple chances if you\u2019re in that in-group and there are just a few people who can make or break your company and that drives into the companies that they invest in and sets the tone for the rest of the industry.

So, they looked at the pattern of the guys from Yahoo, the guys from Google, Mark Zuckerberg and the success factors that they decided were most important, were white, male, nerd and that ended up being the people that they invested in.

She said to me, like, \u201cIf society values people raising their kids, they need to make it possible for people to work and raise their kids at the same time. So, if it values women being involved in raising kids, then women should be given ways to be able to raise their kids while still working.\u201d If you look at companies now, they\u2019re looking at parental leave instead of maternity leave and I think that helps a lot.

It\u2019s really, like your processes for hiring, your processes for promoting, for paying people, for giving performance reviews, for giving opportunities, giving visibility, for giving sponsorship and mentorship, should be fair and it should be inclusive.

It just became this very kind of culture fit based system. And as things continued, like you built systems that were oriented around, \u201cHow do I hire people who look like my friends and look like me?\u201d So, all the hiring processes, all the promotion processes\u2026 You know, you look at the 360-review process, it\u2019s all oriented towards keeping a certain set of people, the traditional establishment successful.

I\u2019m Armenian, and I get it, Armenians are angry with the name of the show. I can be as honest as I want, I hate the name of the show. I despise the name of the show. If I could do anything in the world right now, I would snap my fingers and the name of the show would be different. Unfortunately, the name of a show is a brand, and once you change it, the brand disappears.

What a lot of people don\u2019t even realize \u2013 which is what I find interesting \u2013 is the Young Turks originally arose to challenge the Ottoman Empire which was horrendous to Armenians. And so, at first, they actually wanted to give Armenians more rights because they were disenfranchised and treated horrendously by the Ottomans and that\u2019s how it started out. But then there were rebels within the rebels. There were rebels within the Young Turks that wanted to continue being horrendous to the Armenians, and so, that\u2019s the group that of course, that I hate, I despise beyond words could even explain or describe. My family was tortured, brutalized by Turks and so it\u2019s a difficult issue for me to even talk about without getting emotional. But I just want to assure you guys we have no intentions of denying the genocide, I\u2019ve talked about the genocide on the show.

So I\u2019ll actually talk about it in a more broader sense and how much of an impact it has on everyone regardless of what you\u2019re political ideology is. So in a journalism class that I teach at Cal State Northridge, a lot of the lessons that I discuss is the echo chamber of the Internet. Particularly Google. So everytime you\u2019re searching for something on Google, or every time you go on to one of your favorite websites, whether it be a conservative website or a liberal website, Google keeps track of all that information. We know that. And the reason they do it is because they want to perfect the algorithm to better suit you, so that you\u2019re always exposed to information and content that will always appeal to you. But there\u2019s a huge downside to that, because your entire life becomes an echo chamber. We tend to associate with people we agree with anyway, but the Internet is supposed to be a place where we go, where we have unlimited resources to educate ourselves. We\u2019re supposed to have an open mind and be exposed to varying opinions and varying perspectives. And Google, in its effort to kind of cater to us, has actually deprived us of different perspectives and I think that\u2019s polarizing American politics even more. And you see it in social media because, again, we tend to be friends with people we agree with. But I would argue that it\u2019s more important to be open-minded to people that you disagree with. Now again, rhetoric matters, so if we\u2019re attacking one another and we\u2019re calling each other names while we disagree, that\u2019s only going to further divide us. Look, I\u2019ve been guilty of that as well, so I\u2019ve got to be honest, but everyone in a while after my rage relaxes and I tone it down, I try to think about the conversation I just had and I try to think about whether or not that other person had a point. Best example is when I was debating about prostitution and whether or not we should legalize it, with Cenk Uyger, the host of our show. And he\u2019s in favor of legalizing and regulating it and at that time, I had bought into the conservative propaganda and I\u2019m like \u201cNo! You legalize it and there\u2019s going to be prostitutes everywhere!\u201d And we\u2019d gotten into a huge fight about it \u2013 I was super stubborn, I wouldn\u2019t agree \u2013 I was like \u201cNo! You\u2019re wrong! You\u2019re wrong! I don\u2019t want to brothels right next to schools! It\u2019s going to be terrible!\u201d And then I started secretly on the down low, doing my own research, like what the pros and cons, what\u2019s happening in other countries that have legalized prostitution. And I started changing my mind. And all I ask is that we all keep an open mind, let\u2019s go out of our way to expose ourselves to the other perspectives.")),o.a.createElement(te.a,null,o.a.createElement("p",null,o.a.createElement("strong",null,"Audience Member:")," If you look at independent, media-based kinds of resources that are customizable, specifically the Young Turks, you guys target a very much more progressive audience which seems to contribute to this kind of echo-chamber effect, so do you feel that your outlet is at all responsible in part for this kind of polarization?

Because of the corruption and the politics, Democrats and Republicans behave very similarly once they\u2019re elected into office. And so we talk about that a lot, and so, like I said earlier on during my talk when President Obama was elected and we started criticizing him, people who wanted the echo chamber started dropping like flies and it sucked. We felt like we made a lot of progress with the show in 2008, like oh, we grew our audience, we thought our audience was great and then all of a sudden our subscriber base just dropped. It didn\u2019t just stagnate, all of a sudden you see a huge dip. And you also saw that dip during this election when Hillary Clinton was nominated and we had to keep it real with the audience and be like, \u201cHey, Hillary Clinton is now the Democratic nominee.\u201d And we had varying voices and a lot of disagreement on our network about whether or not we should vote for a third party, whether or not we should support Hillary, is it better to have Trump. And the theory behind that was well if you elect Trump, he\u2019s going to burn the country to the ground and start again. Literally, there were people on our network that have theories like that. And so, there was a lot of disagreement on the echo chamber, just because we come from a progressive point of view doesn\u2019t mean we totally agree with one another so we really go out of our way to make sure we don\u2019t have an echo chamber and I think our audience also reflects that.")),o.a.createElement(te.a,null,o.a.createElement("p",null,o.a.createElement("strong",null,"Audience member:")," I\u2019m a huge fan of your show, and the feed on Tuesday was one of the few things that kept me sane.

Like it was the hardest thing to stomach, to see what the DNC did, to see what Debbie Wasserman-Schultz did in manipulating the primaries to ensure that we had a flawed candidate as the Democratic nominee and that ultimately led to Trump winning. And so, what we want to do is we want to fight and Cenk is a little more aggressive in his wording, but he wants to go to war.

In fact, that\u2019s something we have been trying to do for many years now, and we\u2019re going to be able to continue to do that, especially with this patent decision. The technology is a fundamental, foundational technology. So, we want to make sure that as many people have access to that as possible. So, MIT and the Broad Institute have been adopting a non-exclusive licensing approach. So, any party, academics, can use it freely. Commercial entities can have a nonexclusive license. That doesn\u2019t preclude anybody else from doing it. I think that\u2019s the way that we should approach these kinds of technologies. Make it accessible. Do not stifle progress, and really enabling as many people as possible.")),o.a.createElement(te.a,null,o.a.createElement("p",null,o.a.createElement("strong",null,"Michael Chien"),": You spoke very thoroughly about how the methodology of your research, and I want to focus a little bit more on the ideation process and the potential applications. As you mentioned, the CRISPR-cas9 system was originally discovered in bacteria, in archaea, which use it to develop immunity through storing the genetic signature of viruses that previously attacked it. How did you initially make that connection that this system might be modified for the purpose of gene editing in other organisms?")),o.a.createElement(te.a,null,o.a.createElement("p",null,o.a.createElement("strong",null,"Feng Zhang"),": So, I had been working on genome editing for a while before I started work on the CRISPR-cas9 system. So, there were earlier generations, like I showed on slides, there\u2019s sometimes meganucleases. So, when I was a graduate student at Stanford, at one time I worked on optogenetics. So optogenetics has three needs that I needed to solve. The first is, how do you get neurons to become light sensitive? And that was done by developing these microbial opsin proteins so that we can express the neurons to confer light sensitivity. The second challenge was, how do you deliver light into the brain when the skull is opaque? So, if you just shine light the frontal skull, it doesn\u2019t work. So, then I developed a way to use optical fibers to implant into a specific brain region, and then be able to see into the cells. The third one is, how do you get the opsins to express in a specific group of cells, not any kind of neuron, only a subset of neurons. So, as a graduate student I had developed a ton of different methods to do that using either viral vectors or using a crude recombinant system with CRE Driver mice to get cell-specific expression. But I really wanted to get access to specific cell types in any kind of organism. Maybe eventually even human for clinical translation. So, when I thought about how to do that, one of the things that I thought about is to develop nucleuses to be able to cleave a specific promoter in the genome, that\u2019s specific to a subtype cell, so that you can insert the opsin genes into that specific genomous region, so that is expressed only in the cell that we\u2019re interested in, in the nuclei. When I started to work on CRISPR, after I left Stanford, I realized that these nucleuses are pretty challenging to use. And so that\u2019s really problematic. And also, a lot of the reagents were not readily available at the time. So, it\u2019s around that time that I started to read about other kinds of systems, and I stumbled upon a system called TALE. Transcription activator-like effector. It was in 2010, it was just starting to become understood how TALE proteins are able to recognize DNA sequences. So, I worked on developing that, and so that turned out to be an efficient system to reprogram and recognize specific DNA sequences. So, I started my lab in the beginning of 2011, and I thought maybe I can start using TALE systems to study neurobiology. I can teach students to build them, and to be able to engineer specific cell types in the brain. But that turned out to be quite cumbersome. As I was teaching students to build TALEs, I realized that each TALE construction project is really a serious project on its own. And so, if we had to build these complicated systems, it is quite challenging. So, I started to think about, are there other systems that you can also use for reprogrammable genome editing? It was in the beginning of 2011 when I just started lab, that I went to a talk at the Broad Institute. Mike Gilmore was a professor there, and he had a talk on his work on Enterococcus bacteria. But he had casually mentioned that in Enterococcus he also find these CRISPR systems. And so, when I heard about CRISPR systems, I didn\u2019t know what it was. And so, I went to try to look it up. When I started to look it up on Wikipedia, and also started to read some of the papers, I realized that this is an endonuclease. This is, furthermore, an RNA guided endonuclease. So, it\u2019s also around that time that Sylvain Moineau from the Laval University in Canada, had published a paper in Nature showing that the cas9 system is an RNA guided single nucleus that can make a double strand breaks inside the bacterial cells. When I saw that, I got really excited. I thought\u2026there\u2019s this new system CRISPR-cas9 that maybe you can harness to be able to reprogram by just giving it a short RNA guide. And so that\u2019s how the idea started. If I wasn\u2019t thinking about genome editing of nucleuses before, when I heard that talk in the beginning of 2011, I probably wouldn\u2019t have realized the potential.")),o.a.createElement(te.a,null,o.a.createElement("p",null,o.a.createElement("strong",null,"Michael Chien"),": Well the progression of your research, from not only your graduate schooling but all the way up until now, has shown immense potential for really curing diseases.

You know? Whereas, I can\u2026I can spend as much time as I want in the topic that I want to talk about.

And once I can understand them, then I know that I\u2019m ready to go back to the beginning and explain it at a level that doesn\u2019t necessarily need for knowledge of all of the symbols and the words. So, with, like, Banack Tarski, I couldn\u2019t even find a mathematician that could explain it, so, I just met with a mathematician at the Brit Lab, Youtube channel and just, like, presented the video to her, like, live, and she was able to follow it and I said \u201cOkay, print.

But, it\u2019s not like I turn on the camera and I just know it all. It took me weeks or months and it took me lots of versions and lots of trials and lots of conversations and reading to get to that point. Like, I only have that one book with me because I need to read it in preparation for today, but I have a stack of relativity books and they all say things in different ways. But the more ways you hear someone explain something the more likely you are to finally get it intuitively.

These are moments where you say something significant, the audience wants to, like, write down and tell their friends and family later to make themselves look smarter, funny or whatever. And, kind of, have a certain density with those and every topic has them. So, I just need to make sure that I find enough tidbits that are interesting even in 20 seconds and make sure that they happen frequently enough. But I keep trying to make my videos more boring.

They owned VSauce. And it was a really bizarre, kind of, thing that was not common in Google obviously. They were starting to fund original content but no one at Youtube had ever made a Youtube video. So, they booked Next New Networks that made successful content and also very family friendly content and said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to acquire you. And you guys are going to be called the Next Lab. And you\u2019re going to just, like, have all this knowledge about how to make videos. You\u2019re going to help our clients make better content. Along with that acquisition, VSauce was part of it.

My real job was to be a strategist who would sit down with the BBC or with, you know, UEFA and talk to them about how to make, you know, get more views basically. But as VSauce grew it became more obvious that focusing on that would be my job. So, I never had that nervous moment of how am I going to make ends meet because I was employed by other a big company and there was so many benefits that went along with that, I didn\u2019t have to worry about sponsors. I didn\u2019t have to worry about releasing content fast enough that I was making enough money from the ads. I could just make things that I wanted to. And I had some pressure. You know, I couldn\u2019t not do my job. But the only time it became a problem was when we wanted to grow faster and I couldn\u2019t just say \u201cHey, Google, I want a team of ten people. I want to budget of millions of dollars to make this big show, big experiments.\u201d They\u2019d be like, \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026we\u2019re a tech company.

Now, let\u2019s channel that, in a way that can bring about change. Take my advice, on how to best put the pressure points on the system, to bring about change. Here are the people you need to talk to, here are the people you need to influence. I\u2019m all for immigration reform. I\u2019d like to see us deport fewer people, and focus more on the criminals, because that\u2019s where our resources should be. Not just going after the people who are easiest to apprehend, but spending the time to look for the threats to public safety. That\u2019s the smartest investment of our taxpayer money, and we\u2019re not breaking up families. So, I\u2019m all for immigration reform. I\u2019m all for Congress passing comprehensive immigration reform, that provides for an earned path to citizenship, for those who are undocumented. Now, let\u2019s talk to the people who are not, and see if we can change some minds. And there are ways in Washington, and in Sacramento, and elsewhere, to do that, in an effective way. And so I learned this from the repeal of Don\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell, in 2010. In January, 2010, when I was General Counsel of DoD, the Secretary of Defense, Bob Gates, asked me to do a study, on whether or not the military was ready to repeal Don\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell, along with an Army 4-star general. So, we spent 10 months doing this, and we made our report public. We surveyed 400,000 people, we visited military bases all around the country, in groups this size, we probably hit over 50 bases. Everyone we spoke to had an opinion about gays in the military. Everyone. This wasn\u2019t an issue where people said, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t really know.\u201d And so a lot of people in Congress\u2026 And it required repealing a law, from 1993. A lot of people in Congress were firmly in one camp or another, but there was that swing vote, there were people in the middle, who hadn\u2019t made up their minds. And so that\u2019s who I knew I had to target our report at, the people who wanted to listen, and the people who could be influenced, one way or another, by a thorough, exhaustive study. And we made our report public, on November 30, 2010, and the Congress repealed Don\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell, three weeks later. Frankly, it was an idea whose time had come. But with the advocates for repeal out there, working in the Congress, to influence the votes, that really didn\u2019t make a difference, and it was smart policy change.

Glad you\u2019re getting to see the passionate student body we have here. So, the question I had originally planned to ask you, you\u2019ve already touched upon pretty well. It was a question about the specific strategies that your department\u2019s using to prevent lone wolf terrorism, especially after the Chattanooga shootings. So, I guess I\u2019d just like to ask you if you could go over some more of the specific strategies, if you\u2019re at liberty to, and also leading one of the federal entities that\u2019s been given specific abilities under the Patriot Act.")),o.a.createElement(te.a,null,o.a.createElement("p",null,o.a.createElement("strong",null,"Jeh Johnson"),": Well, let me give you two specific examples, of what we can and should do, and what we are doing, in the current environment. Number one, in July, I announced security enhancements, to what is referred to as our visa waiver program. There are 38\u2026 Can everybody hear me? There are 38 countries, for which we do not require a visa, to come here to this country. We have added security assurances, that we expect to get from those countries, with respect to people who travel here. So, we want those countries to participate to a greater degree in the Interpol Stolen Passport database. Put passports into Interpol, report them when they\u2019re stolen. We want more flights that include federal air marshals from these countries. We want more sharing, we want them to develop, and use advanced passenger information, so that they know who are getting on flights, in their countries, like we do in this country. So, greater security assurances, with respect to countries from which people travel without a visa, to deal, frankly, with the phenomenon of foreign fighters. All these people who are leaving countries, and on occasion, this country, to go to Iraq and Syria to take the fight. So, that\u2019s one thing. I mentioned before, countering violent extremism. So, one of the things that we can and should do, and we are doing, is encouraging communities to prevent and interdict, before it becomes a matter of law enforcement. A lot of people that the FBI arrest are very young people, younger than you. And so we want to encourage work with communities, give them support where necessary, to intervene, and interdict, before somebody decides they want to pick up, and get on a flight, and travel to Syria. So, those are two examples. One of the things that I also want to do, and that we are doing, we\u2019re building more of, is something called pre-clearance capability, overseas. If you get on a flight from Amsterdam, to the United States, for example, you\u2019ll see the customs capability, once we make this arrangement, at the front end, not the back end. Passengers actually like it, because when you get off that 8-hour plane ride, the first thing you want to do, is hop in the Uber, or the taxi. You don\u2019t want to sit around, in a long line, waiting to be asked a lot of questions, by my customs officers. Do it on the front end, when you\u2019re fresh, and we know more about somebody, before they get on the airplane. So, that\u2019s the type of direction we\u2019re moving in. We\u2019re also more sophisticated, and better at connecting the dots, among our interagency, and we want to do the same, with our good counterterrorism partners overseas, with respect to individuals of suspicion. Okay. Next question.")),o.a.createElement(te.a,null,o.a.createElement("p",null,o.a.createElement("strong",null,"Audience Member"),": Hi, Secretary Johnson. And my question is in response to the refugee crisis in Europe and the Middle East, Germany has promised entrance of 800,000 refugees, Venezuela, 20,000 refugees, and only a couple days ago, did Obama promise 10,000 refugees could make their home here. And I\u2019m wondering why has there been such hesitancy, and what are you and your department going to do to speed up the process, for the refugees coming here, so they don\u2019t have to wait two years in limbo, going through the process of entering a country.")),o.a.createElement(te.a,null,o.a.createElement("p",null,o.a.createElement("strong",null,"Jeh Johnson"),": A couple of things. First, in addition to accepting 10,000 Syrian refugees, the United States government already provides billions of dollars in humanitarian assistance, to the refugee problem right now, something like 4 billion. We\u2019re the biggest single donor to that effort overseas. So, that\u2019s one thing. We also have\u2026 We\u2019ve got Central America, and we\u2019ve got Mexico. So, as I\u2019ve mentioned before, something like 330,000 apprehensions on our Southern border, many of whom will apply for asylum in this country. I have a finite number of CIS personnel, that can be devoted to screening for asylum, and screening for refugee status. And when you do screening for refugees, they have to go overseas, to places like Iraq, or Jordon, or other places, in border countries. They have to go overseas to do this screening, which means diverting them away from a lot of other immigration services. The other thing about CIS, United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, which is responsible for refugee screening, it is a fee-based organization. It pays for itself through fees, applications, application fees, for green cards, and so forth. So, it\u2019s got to pay for itself, and refugees is not a fee-based activity. So, you\u2019ve got to pay for the refugee screening we do, through fees coming from other types of services. So, we want to do more, we will do more, by way of refugees, by way of direct humanitarian assistance, with our dollars, and we want to do it as quickly as possibly, but like everything in government, you\u2019ve got to do it with the resources that you have. Right now, as I said, Congress has yet to pass a budget for 2016, and unless they affirmatively repeal it, sequestration\u2026 Everybody knows what sequestration is, right? Sequestration is going to kick back in at the beginning of next calendar year, which decapitates my budget. So, lots of times, people want us to do more, but you\u2019ve got to give me more to do it with. And I can\u2019t do more with less. So, if we have to live with sequestration, we have to cut back on immigration services, border security, law enforcement, counterterrorism, aviation security, cybersecurity, Coast Guard, maritime security. We\u2019re still feeling the effects from sequestration, two years ago. So, that is my plea to this room. Support repeal of sequestration, so we can do more, of the types of things, that folks here on this campus want us to do. I have time for one more question. Yes, sir. Right here.")),o.a.createElement(te.a,null,o.a.createElement("p",null,o.a.createElement("strong",null,"Audience Member"),": Ah, yes.

Yes. Unlike the Department of Defense, where I used to work, the Department of Homeland Security has an Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, and an Office of Privacy, that reports directly to me, that is privy to the most sensitive Homeland Security programs we have, that provides exactly that type of balance. And I hear from them directly. They sit in on all the most sensitive meetings, to ensure that we\u2019re not crossing those lines, that we\u2019re not profiling people by race, religion, skin color, and the like, that we\u2019re not crossing the lines, in terms of inhibiting travel, and so forth. And that\u2019s something that I personally believe we absolutely, we have to do. Actually, I do want to say one more thing. To the students here. When I was in college, I wanted to be in public service, politics. I wanted to be in public service, and I never lost that dream. I went to law school, I got sucked into the Wall Street corporate law thing for a while, but I never lost the dream of public service. And so I came back to it, I\u2019ve been four times in public service. As a federal prosecutor, as General Counsel of the Air Force, General Counsel of DoD, and now this job, which I never imagined I would be in. And it\u2019s been great every moment, there is never a dull day in my job. And I have, in public service, way more to talk about at parties, than I did at my private corporate law practice. And the basic instinct of all of us is to serve, and to help people, which is what you do most often in public service. So, those of you students who are thinking about a career in public service, at the state, local, or federal level, don\u2019t lose that dream. I hope it stays with you. Even with the mortgage, with the kids, the dog, the tuitions, the student debt. Don\u2019t lose that dream. I haven\u2019t. I made a lot more money in corporate law. Right now, I make less than probably a third year associate, three years out of law school, at my law firm in New York, Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton, and Garrison.

One, I\u2019m restless. I like to do new things. I would say I got addicted to starting companies or starting products when I was at POLITICO. I think I\u2019m decent at it, so I wanted to give it another whirl. The big one, though, is I saw an opportunity. An opportunity, and with the way I look at businesses, now that we start them, is you\u2019ve got to have, what is a need that needs to be filled? If you can fill that need, is there a plausible way to monetization of that idea? To me, the challenge now is different than when we started POLITICO. POLITICO, at the time, all it was filling to me was this need for more political coverage, more depth, with more analysis, hooked up to the web, taking advantage of cable TV. Our belief was that, that was what Washington needed, and our theory was that if Washington needed, anybody who cared about politics would ultimately get sucked into it. Mission accomplished. The new challenge, I\u2019d say, for all of us is the one I outlined up there, which is the world is more complex today than it was a decade ago, and it\u2019s going to get exponentially more complex, and that for people who care about serious news consumption, and I do believe that\u2019s still a nice chunk of the country and a really nice chunk of the world, there has to be a better, more efficient way for people to have a fuller understanding of politics, technology, business, media consumption which is not Katie Couric\u2019s contract, it\u2019s a dissemination in consumption of information, but science, future of work, and so if you look at, if you go to Axios, those are our sections. Every one of the sections that we have are issues that are going to shape the future, all narrated by people who have expertise and following. We have what we call a radiate theory, that if we\u2019re pretty good at getting Jamie Dimon as a reader, the president as a reader, or Sheryl Sandberg as a reader, then our theory is we can write stuff that they find essential, that ultimately that will echo out to anybody else who cares about it. The early results are very encouraging. People respond very well to it, and the neatest thing is, we do reader surveys. We sent one out maybe three months in. We sent it out, and we didn\u2019t have that big a readership at the time. I think 12,000 people filled it out. It took 15 minutes, 6,000 volunteered to answer any question we ever have, and it was so interesting to read it, because people were responding to it using language that we would use inside of our meetings. Say, \u201cOh, you\u2019re helping me get smarter faster.\u201d Oh, you\u2019re making the reading of complex issues more efficient, more understandable, more approachable. This is easy to read, easy to share. It\u2019s clean. Those things are super gratifying. It\u2019s a long way of answering that there was an opportunity that we saw to fill. I believe that we\u2019re filling it, and now I actually think this could be exponentially bigger than we even thought when we launched it nine months ago. That\u2019s to me one of the most astonishing things. We just launched nine months ago, and I knew we were on to something when two months in the New York Times was quoting Axios without saying what it is. I was like, \u201cCome on.\u201d Two months in, as a new publication, and at least for people in the media, people in politics, people in technology, that they were that familiar with it, that they assumed their readership was familiar with it. I know that a lot of people aren\u2019t familiar with it, so it probably should\u2019ve explained what it was, and then said Axios.com.")),o.a.createElement(te.a,null,o.a.createElement("p",null,o.a.createElement("strong",null,"Michael Chien:")," When you talk about, one of the resounding motifs of your address was this trust in specific that the media and journalism is now operating in.

I love that people put money into not-for-profits. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the best solution for journalism. I think for-profit companies are the best. There\u2019s only a couple ways to make money in journalism. You can sell subscriptions, you can sell ads, you can do events. They\u2019re basically the three ways of making money in journalism. For me, as long as you\u2019re marking something as sponsored content or as an ad, I\u2019m all for it. I\u2019m very pro-it. What we did is, we said, \u201cOkay, let\u2019s sit down.\u201d If you\u2019re going to design an ad that provides the least amount of intrusion and distraction for the reader but forces the reader to interact with it in a way that the advertiser gets value. Too many media companies, \u201cOh, advertisers.\u201d It\u2019s your money. If you don\u2019t have advertising, you don\u2019t have money. You don\u2019t have money, you don\u2019t have a job. You don\u2019t have, then there\u2019s no company. You want to make that experience beautiful for the reader, beautiful for the advertiser. All we did is, we looked at, what is the best experience out there for the advertiser, for the reader? It\u2019s with Facebook, setting up the nice stream, where you go through because it\u2019s there. You can choose whether or not to stop. You\u2019re working with a small space, so if you\u2019re clever about your graphics, your video, your headlines, you can actually get awesome interaction with it. Our ads have a 2-4x engagement improvement from any other ad for that very reason, because we put a lot of time, thinking, into the making those as beautiful as the content themselves. As long as they\u2019re labeled, that\u2019s all you can do. That\u2019s all you should do, and you need them. If you take them away, you\u2019ve got nothing, because one of the dumbest things the media industry did, maybe one of the dumbest things any industry has done in the history of all industries, was that our industry, when the Internet came along, we said, \u201cHey, you know what? Let\u2019s all band together. Let\u2019s take a product that\u2019s extremely expensive to produce, really valuable,\u201d something the consumer really likes a lot, \u201cYou know what we should do? Let\u2019s give it away for free.\u201d Wouldn\u2019t that be an awesome idea? That\u2019s what we did for ten years. We habituated an entire generation of consumers to take something for free that costs a lot of money. You don\u2019t get your music for free. You don\u2019t get your movies for free. You don\u2019t get your food for free. We were giving away a product for free. That needs to be corrected, and one way is through subscriptions. You\u2019ve been habituated to not pay for content. Other than the New York Times, the Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, FT. I would say the Wall Street Journal and the FT are business expenses, so I put that on a different category. The New York Times and only recently the Washington Post, there\u2019s very few examples of content companies that people are willing to pay enough money for to support a viable media company. That is what it is. I\u2019m talking about the written news space. Maybe that changes with time. I don\u2019t know. We\u2019ll see if it does. That\u2019s an open question.

Among all the things we\u2019ve talked about, from the Internet, to advertising, to quality content, fake news, a lot of people would say that money is the biggest factor when it comes to journalism management. You\u2019ve said in the past that, at POLITICO, you guys reached what you called a nirvana, where 50% of your revenue came from ads, the other 50% was subscriptions. Why is it not 100 to 0? Is that because it\u2019s not feasible, or is it because the ads genuinely provide, I guess, value for the stakeholders and for the readers, in consuming that content?")),o.a.createElement(te.a,null,o.a.createElement("p",null,o.a.createElement("strong",null,"Jim VandeHei"),": The reason is that, number one, at POLITICO, the subscription side is not like the New York Times. At POLITICO we created what we call POLITICO Pro, which is a high-end subscription service for people who are doing politics and policy professionally. The starting price is $8,000. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re buying that or we\u2019re buying that. You would have to be doing it as a business. It turned out to be an awesome business, but if that\u2019s all we did, all we would\u2019ve been doing is writing content for a very small sliver of people that saw great value in it, but you\u2019re not really doing the public service dimension of it. If I just wanted to build a business just to make money, that\u2019s what I would do. It\u2019s the easiest way to make money in journalism right now, high-end information, charge a lot of money, boom. I don\u2019t like that. I like it as a business, but I don\u2019t like it alone. I like it if it helps support public journalism. POLITICO, a couple weeks ago, it was one of the finest moments since I left POLITICO, to watch, we had created healthcare verticals, our first one cost you about ten grand for a company or association to get it. Our theory was, if we could get six or eight people covering healthcare, and you\u2019re doing it with people who\u2019ve been doing it at the most granular level, a couple times a year, they\u2019re going to come across awesome journalism of political consequence, or there\u2019s going to be a difficult, complex debate, but you\u2019re going to have all this brainpower behind it, and you take that content, and you put it public. The group of people that exposed the HHS secretary and forced him out, because he was doing illegal travel, was from that POLITICO Pro team. The theory of the case worked, but you need, I think you need, both. The public dimension of journalism is why I\u2019m a journalist. The fact that you can make a difference, you can inform tons of people, that you can help shape how people are seeing really important ideas. That part of it, at least based on the economics and the habits today, has to be supported by advertising. There\u2019s not another way around it.

The point of the piece was that the system needs a shock. In some ways, you need something different than we have, and throughout different ideas, like Zuckerberg, whoever, but somebody who\u2019s thinking about it differently, in that, and I actually believe this even more powerfully today than I did then. The system, put aside Trump. The system in some ways is so detached from the reality that we\u2019re about to have. We have two political parties that spend their time arguing about things that made a lot of sense 15 years ago, made some sense 10 years ago, still make a little bit of sense, but they\u2019re not actually the topics that are going to define whether or not China eats our lunch in the next 20 years. We\u2019ve got, we want. You\u2019ve got to be able to modernize government. Cybersecurity, I guarantee the catastrophe we have will flow from some cyber attack that none of us are thinking about right now. If you don\u2019t have the right technologists and the right technology, redoing government, we\u2019re hugely vulnerable. Then you take that overseas. We grew up in a time of conventional wars. We\u2019re going to take boots on the ground. We\u2019re going to go to war with another country. That\u2019s never going to happen again. All of these things are going to be fought in space, and they\u2019re going to be fought with drones. Any given day, this very day, this would have been true under Obama too, we\u2019re executing people via drone in four different countries. Have been for the last six-seven years. Will be probably forever. Our enemies aren\u2019t necessarily just going to be nation states. They\u2019re going to be things like Al Qaeda metastasizing into ISIS, which will metastasize into something else which requires a government that basically fought wars the same way for a long time to rethink about the War Powers Act. How do you move fast enough to be able to adapt to these different threats? Then, you look domestically. What is the fundamental challenge? You can bemoan globalization all you want, and there\u2019s pros and cons to it, but the technology is only going to bring people and countries closer together, markets closer together. That is the arc of history. I don\u2019t believe you can bend it any other way. Then, you have to look at the country. You say, \u201cWhat is it that we need to do to make sure that, this is the best damn country ten years from now?\u201d One, you\u2019d better make sure that this is the place that people want to come and start businesses. It still is. People love this country. They might be down on it because of Trump or different dynamics that we have, but people love America. They still think it\u2019s the best place to start companies, the best place to birth new ideas. If you don\u2019t get that right over time, if you don\u2019t get, are we getting people who come here? Are we getting immigrants who want to come here, start companies? They come here, start companies, and stay here. Are you then creating a tax code that makes sense in a globalized system, where you have mass amounts of competitors that might have a competitive disadvantage or competitive advantage overseas? You need to be able to rewire the country on the domestic side and on the foreign side to make sure that we continue to crush it. We are, for all the hangdog crap I hear about, \u201cOh, my God! America\u2019s going to Hell!\u201d It\u2019s not going to Hell. I\u2019ve spent, we\u2019ve built a company in Europe before we left POLITICO. I\u2019d much, much, much rather be an American than be sitting in Europe. They\u2019re in a lot of trouble. Their governing system doesn\u2019t work. Their borders are really poor. They\u2019re dealing with terrorists threats and the effects of that, and migration in ways that are much more powerful than some of the debates that we\u2019re having here. \u201cOh, China, China, China!\u201d Come on. Yes, they could steal our ideas, which they do. They can bully companies into doing things in their country. They can do that. They have lots of people, but it\u2019s a crappy governing system that doesn\u2019t have as dynamic of a culture, and is not, I don\u2019t believe, going to be a long-term threat, as big a long-term threat as people fear, if we get those things right. Otherwise, if we don\u2019t, it will, or India will, or Vietnam will, or whoever else will. That\u2019s a long way of answering the journal piece about just saying, I do think that there probably needs to be a new set of ideas that people are talking about, and it actually might happen soon, because if somebody\u2019s, look at what\u2019s happening with the two parties. In some ways, we probably should have four political parties right now, because the difference between the Trump wing of the party and the Ryan wing of the party, they\u2019re almost two different parties. They have really pulled themselves apart. The difference between the Clinton wing and the Sanders wing is pretty profound. I think really profound, and that Sanders wing is only getting pulled further to the left. In some ways, if you have four different parties right now on a lot of these topics, you might have the Sanders wing and the Trump wing often teaming up, especially when it comes to issues like trade, US jobs, and so I don\u2019t know how this plays out. All I know is that every single job, every single sector, is getting disrupted and will continue to get disrupted. I don\u2019t think politics is any different. Is technology or technologists, the Zuckerbergs of the world, the solution? I don\u2019t know. I think that those companies have a bigger political priority. I don\u2019t think Mark Zuckerberg hired David Plouffe and other people because he\u2019s thinking he\u2019s going to run for president. I think he\u2019s smartly realized he has a hell of a political problem on his hands, that the more people learn about what\u2019s happening on Facebook, the more they\u2019re going to see their popularity fade, the more that they\u2019re going to see regulators regulate. It is the single biggest story in this country this year, if you didn\u2019t have Trump as president. It is basically, now, have this country starting to look at these big social platforms that we give all of our data, all of our time, all of our mindshare, and people are starting to think, \u201cWhoa, wait a second. Did we give them too much?\u201d Were they too unregulated? Is there too much mischief happening that we weren\u2019t aware of, and should there be a correction? I think there\u2019ll be a correction, and I think Europe in some ways is a template there, because Europe has a much different view of data privacy, data protection, and these big companies than we do. They regulate them more. They tax them more. They fine them more, and that creates a template for what could happen, here. I\u2019m not guaranteeing it does happen here. We had, last week, we had Sheryl Sandberg. We\u2019re the one company that interviewed her for a half hour. Mike Allen, on stage, grilled her pretty powerfully. They know they\u2019re in for a grilling on Capitol Hill about what was happening on that platform, what responsibility they have to be aware of it sooner than they actually were, and what do they have to do now to make sure that, that doesn\u2019t happen again? That\u2019s an amazing story. I think the best book that\u2019s going to be written is going to be the Mueller Report. Think about it. Everyone\u2019s like, \u201cOh, is he going to indict Trump?\u201d I don\u2019t know. I have my own theories on that, but what he is going to do is, he\u2019s not just looking at Trump. He\u2019s looking at the entire system. He is going to pull together a report that looks at a foreign company, manipulating for the price of doughnuts, our election, on an unregulated platform, that may or may not have been in cahoots with either a campaign, or elements around a campaign, to undoubtedly influence at least in some ways the election. We\u2019ll never know if it was decisive, but we\u2019ll know that it was profound and potentially decisive, but we\u2019ll never know decisive, that then has spawned all kinds of crazy activity, including the firing of Comey, which probably will go down in history as one of the dumbest things that a president\u2019s ever done, because it then gave him Robert Mueller, who will write the report that I\u2019m talking about.")),o.a.createElement(te.a,null,o.a.createElement("p",null,"[Laughter]")),o.a.createElement(te.a,null,o.a.createElement("p",null,o.a.createElement("strong",null,"Jim VandeHei"),": It\u2019s a fad.

I love that we have lots of not-for-profits that are doing investigative reporting, which is the hardest type of reporting to actually create a business model around, but to me, you\u2019re going to always end up with a mix of all those things, and so if it works in Canada, it\u2019s great that it works in Canada. I will say, if you go to Britain, the SUF, the BBC, but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s often the dominant voice.

Newsletters, in terms of really especially hyper-engaged readers, they\u2019re awesome. Our newsletters do extraordinarily well, and people love it. Why?

I think what we\u2019ll see, and I think you\u2019ll hopefully see it from us, is to me ideally newsletters, podcasts, all of that stuff blends itself into an app stream, meaning that you have a watch/listen/read experience that\u2019s tailored to what you might want or the way you want to consume information utilizing all these technologies which are a lot cheaper to do today than they would\u2019ve been three or four years ago. That will be a great, great, great consumption experience and is a great production experience. The opportunity [is splendid]. How many people here are in journalism or are going to go into the media? I don\u2019t know who you have in here. I think sometimes people come in, and they\u2019re like, \u201cOh, my God!

She is the smartest person I\u2019ve ever met thinking about media. She had this thing the other day about how Netflix now is almost tied with ESPN in terms of paying for content. Imagine if you had Snapchat, not paying for it, but now Snapchat will pay for it, but better rev shares now. Facebook\u2019s starting to pay for a lot more content. All of these new distribution channels that are going to replace cable, and nobody knows what will replace it, but everyone knows something will replace it. The demand for video content, demand for audio content, the demand for I would still say text-based content, it\u2019s only getting better. You\u2019re growing up with that skill set, and you\u2019re growing up with those consumption habits, so you\u2019re actually much better positioned to help solve the future than somebody who\u2019s my age or older, and grew up in a static, \u201cI just read a newspaper this way,\u201d experience. You should not go into the profession being bummed. You should go into it being very, very, very optimistic. People are, like I said, if they\u2019re consuming 12 hours of media content of some form each and every day, just get in the fight for their mindshare. That\u2019s what it is, now. It\u2019s now a battle of mindshare, that\u2019s why you have all of these companies trying to diversify. Facebook, at point you hit all the people you\u2019re going to hit, and you then win all of that battle to get more and more mindshare over the course of the day. That\u2019s going to benefit the content producers, the content distributors, the content editors, and so it\u2019s a great time to go and be a part of that. The podcasts will be part of it. Podcasts, often we chase mirages in our industry. We\u2019re like, \u201cOh, traffic.\u201d Then you wake up, \u201cActually, it\u2019s not that great.\u201d Then, it was video five years ago. Great, you produce a lot of video. It turns out you still couldn\u2019t monetize it. Podcasts were hot. I always said, \u201cShow me.\u201d Yes, that\u2019s great. You\u2019ve got X-number of viewers or X-number of listeners. How much money you making off that? How much money did it cost you to produce it? If the cost of production is greater than the money you\u2019re making off it, it\u2019s not actually a profitable business. It might be a good investment long term. It\u2019s essentially not a good business. Podcasts are still, for the most part, still there. They get a good audience, but there\u2019s not a ton of money attached to it. Doesn\u2019t mean that there won\u2019t be. I think it\u2019ll come from all of that stuff starting to live together and some of the stuff sorting itself out in terms of, we have so many content producers now, and so many distribution networks.

I haven\u2019t been there in nine months and I\u2019m still frustrated by it. But that the essence of our system, and if you think about it, this is the vulnerability in our political ecosystem that Trump has expertly capitalized on, exploited.
