		'In the first half of the twentieth century, the average New York Times editor might never see California, the average New York Times reader might not have either. Much has changed since then. The Times now has more than two dozen journalists based up and down the state and more readers in the state than anywhere else in the country, including New York. Ms. Bloom will talk about the evolution of how The Times has covered California over the years, the major themes and issues its focusing on in the year ahead and what challenges The Times and other national news organizations face in trying to cover such a diverse and complex place as California.',
