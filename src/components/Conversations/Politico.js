					US Senator Rand Paul appeared at the Berkeley Forum on March 19, 2014. Senator Paul discussed the implications of NSA’s surveillance activities on liberty and his potential plans to run for the 2016 Republican nomination for President. The event was moderated by Matthew Freeman.
					</p>

					<strong>Matthew Freeman:</strong> Conservative activist, Larry Clayman, and the ACLU have also filed similar lawsuits against the NSA. And both resulted in either failure or a stayed ruling. What makes you think that you’ll have any more success than these groups that have tried before you?
					</p>
				</Row>
				<Row>
					
				<p>
				<strong>Rand Paul:</strong> 
				I am supportive of all the other lawsuits, so it isn’t exclusive that mine is the best, but it is slightly different. The ACLU lawsuit was ruled against. The judge either threw it out or said that the program was constitutional. The Clayman suit is in the same court that mine will go to. And the judges previously ruled it unconstitutional, stayed the ruling, and I think it will be appealed. So, I think the Clayman suit is still active. Ours is going to the same court because it has a similar subject. Our case is slightly different, and we think, for some legal reasons, that it may have a change of going all the way to the Supreme Court.
				<br></br><br></br>
				To me, it’s not so much that my case has to go, but I think a case needs to go to the Supreme Court. Because currently, many people believe that the Fourth Amendment doesn’t apply to all. They think that the reason why you can give a single warrant to Verizon is that you don’t own those records. I think they’re jointly held. I think if you sign a privacy agreement, Verizon agrees not to tell your neighbor who you’re calling. So, they kind of acknowledge that. I think it’s acknowledging that you still have an interest in those records.
				<br></br><br></br>
				But to me, the most important thing is… And there’s at least, we think, four or five Supreme Court justices that have indicated that in this digital age, think about it, it’s a lot different than 1975. That’s when the last case, Smith versus Maryland, was held on records. It’s also different. That was about one suspect’s phone tap. We’re now talking about 300 million Americans’ phones. So, I think it’s a big deal, and it is different than what we’ve ever had before. So, I’m hoping that we will get all the way to the Supreme Court.

					<strong> Matthew Freeman:</strong> So, earlier, you condemned director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, for allegedly lying in front of Congress. You said he’s very explicitly broken the law. Does that mean that you think he should be sent to prison?
					</p>
				</Row>
				<Row  >
					<p>
					<strong>Rand Paul:</strong> 
					I think he should be. You don’t get sent to prison until you’re found guilty. So, we should have a trial. He deserves a trial. But the interesting thing is I’m not an outlier on this in the sense that I think seven members of the Intelligence Committee or Judiciary Committee in the House have signed a letter saying the same thing. And I think it hurts us because we do have to rely on some things being secret. And it’s an extraordinary power. It’s a power to capture people, incarcerate people. It’s even a power to kill people. So, that power needs to be overseen, and they have to be honest with us. If the people in charge of the Intelligence Committee are not being honest to Congress, and they’re actually spying on Congress, I have grave doubts about everything they’re telling me.
					<br></br><br></br>
					So, yeah, I think it is important. And one of the reasons I bring it up is that many of these people, they want to throw the book at Snowden. And I have mixed feelings what should happen, because I think you can’t release secrets all the time. That would lead to chaos. But at the same time, I think he also wanted to reveal something he thought was unconstitutional. But for all the people that want to throw the book and the letter of the law at Snowden, I like the contrast. They don’t want to do a thing…not a peep out of them for Clapper. So, you’re not really being consistent if you want to throw the book at Snowden, but you don’t want to do a thing to Clapper. They both broke the law technically. And then you have to decide what justice is. But yeah, I think Clapper should be tried for perjury.

					<strong>Matthew Freeman:</strong>Matthew Freeman: So, you say you’re asked this all the time, but we want to get in here, too. Would you classify Edward Snowden as on the one hand a hero or a traitor? And to phrase that slightly differently maybe, if there were another Edward Snowden out there, would you encourage him to speak up?
					</p>
				</Row>
				<Row  >
					<p>
					<strong>Rand Paul:</strong> I think the ultimate decision of hero or villain in history is going to sort out. And I think there are pros and cons to a lot of it. And I know people have a strong feeling about it. I think that his intentions were good. But here’s the problem – let’s say we have 400, 500 people here, and let’s say you all are… We’re talking to you, and you’re the new recruits for the CIA or for the intelligence for our army. Should I tell all 500 of you, “Just decide when you think it’s unconstitutional and just reveal secrets any time.” You could see how it could lead to chaos. But at the same time, I’m very upset about what our intelligence community is doing, and we might not have ever known about it had Snowden not leaked it. Some say Snowden should have tried to become a whistleblower.
					<br></br><br></br>
					I don’t know if he did try or what the process is. But I think on the one hand, you have chaos. Bradley Manning released 24 million pages. There’s a chance that people could die from that. There’s a chance that intelligence could get out, and it could endanger our agents. And I’m not against spying. We will have people gathering intelligence around the world. And I don’t think that we can allow willy-nilly indiscriminate release of documents. But at the same time, I’m sympathetic to what was released, because I think it’s a real problem. So, I have mixed feeling is the bottom line.

					<strong>Matthew Freeman:</strong> So, you posed a very interesting question during your address. You asked about potential CIA spying on Senate computers. To quote you, “If the CIA is spying on Congress, who exactly can or will stop them?” So, what would be your answer to this question?
					</p>
				</Row>

				<Row  >
					<p>
					<strong>Rand Paul:</strong> Well, see, here’s the interesting thing. And this is worth everybody reading about. The way I understand it… And this is what Senator Feinstein said in her speech. They came across something… They were given access to the CIA computers by the CIA. The search engine was created by the CIA. They say… And I’m just going from what they’re telling me. They say they found a report called the Pennetta Review which looked into some previous activities in the CIA – interrogation and detention. And they got it through the search engine. If that’s true, the CIA then may have said, “Oh, whoops. We didn’t want you to read that.” But think about that. If it was a mistake by the CIA, you can say, “Well, that was a mistake.”
